Hi folks, my name is Tris. I’m a podcaster and video producer, I’m a musician. In fact, I started out doing anything creative or in public by being a musician. My first career was as a web developer, and I did production on the side for 15 years, but in 2022 I accidentally became entirely self employed thanks to the surprising success of my YouTube channel, No Boilerplate. I am here with my friend Robin. Hi Robin.\nRobin: Hi\nTris: Tell the listeners about yourself.\nRobin: I’m Tris’s friend\nI’m nowhere near as impressive in my output as Tris. I am a father. I’ve always wanted to be a father and I’m very proud of, being a father to my children. I’m a big fan of openness and transparency and open source. I’ve been a web developer and team leader for about 18 years. I worked for Canonical for 10 years, I worked with what is now our mutual friend, and that’s how I got introduced to Tris, and then Tris got me a job at Canonical, we worked together there for a bit, and you know, we’ve known each other ever since,\nI have a lot of thoughts about how to solve technical problems, as well as, How to solve other problems, and I’m a little bit obsessed with politics.\n[00:01:10] Why are we here &amp; defining decapsulate\nTris: we are here because I love talking about tech. I especially love talking about tech with you, and there are some parts of my, video audio creation writer world that I’d love for other people to get a little insight into.\nAnd I found that speaking with. You is a great foil occasionally, although that is a backhanded compliment. But certainly you’re very good at asking difficult questions that I appreciate you asking. “ Appreciate“ in, like, scare quotes.\nRobin: I feel like I do sort of challenge you in a way that I, I’m surprised you’re okay with. I often feel a bit bad about it\nafterwards.\nTris: You’re right. That’s probably the perfect interviewer, or, host attitude.\nRobin: I feel like your interpretation of\ndecapsulate was different than mine. When you\nfirst said it, I thought it sounded like a great name. And,\nTris: Oh no.\nRobin: no, no, no. I think it’s good. I think this was\ninteresting.\nIt was interesting that you related it more to software\nthan I did,\nTris: Yes, because encapsulation means bringing everything inside an interface of some sort and bringing along the things you\nneed inside that\nto work, maybe through internal data and internal functions or something like\nthat. How did you interpret it?\nRobin: Well, I think, I suppose I think that decapsulate is maybe a synonym for unpack\nTris: I really like that word unpack.\nRobin: I do think that it was, it’d be very interesting to talk about why we identify with unpacking things.\nBecause I think we do, I think lately I’ve started to feel more\nlike I’ve noticed more that people around me are not as interested\nin getting to the details, talking about the details of stuff as I am. I have to be aware of that because particularly in work, there’s a lot of things where I’m like, if we were to think seriously about this problem, then we would define the basis of what we’re trying to achieve.\nAnd then we would work out what flows from there. I always want to delve into the fine details of designing the solution clearly in a way that other people, are often quite frustrated by.\nThe thing that people don’t seem that interested in is more like the focus. I tend to want to look at things from many angles. I think that you aren’t, you haven’t really discovered the truth until you’ve looked at it from many angles. And I think also, discovering the truth is really important. A lot of people aren’t necessarily on the same page as me in all those ways.\nThey aren’t necessarily interested in the truth. seeing things from a few angles and making sure they’ve found the truth at the heart of it. Do you know what I mean?\nTris: Yes, it’s one of the reasons I really like talking with you, wise people are full of doubt and fools are so certain, and you’re really uncertain you’re not persuaded as easily as I am of something, there’ll be many cases where I will state something I know you agree with.\nI’ll state an opinion or state some facts about the internet or technology or society or whatever and I will state it in a way that is not buttoned up and watertight and you will disagree with me and argue with me, which is confusing for me, well it was until I got used to it, and we’ll\nGo round a little bit and I’ll be very, very confused because you’ll be arguing Against\nsomething I thought you really believed in and I might eventually say don’t you agree with me and you say yes I do but not the way you said it like you did not present a good argument\nRobin: This isn’t a very charitable presentation.\nTris: No, it is this is how I would like to be this is a very aspirational way of doing things Annoying perhaps but when we’re talking about important topics It’s important to have the facts right and the take right? You can’t just say something that is too simple or oversimplified. Um, and this is because you are trying to find the truth, which makes you a great podcast host.\nRobin: well, we’ll see, see\n[00:04:47] Podcasts are great\nTris: podcasts, I think, are my favorite thing. To write and to produce because audio is such a personal medium. I just want to do more and more, which is why we’re here today. Thank you, Robin, for enabling my addiction.\nRobin: Is this the first podcast where you’re\ntalking as you,\nTris: it is. And I’m terrified because I’m usually no good without a script.\nRobin: I think you’re doing fantastically well, you know, your voice is crisp and polished and your explanations are fluid. I think you’re going to, listen back to it and discover that you absolutely don’t need a\nscript. This is my favorite form of podcast and I found it quite interesting because I remember, the party we had on Saturday, your birthday.\nSo happy birthday again.\nTris: Thank you so much. I am 38, if you can believe it.\nRobin: Your friend, who I won’t name because they haven’t agreed to it, said, are you planning on doing any podcasts or something like that to you? And because they. Understand a podcast to be what I also understand a podcast to be, which is people talking, usually a conversation, nonfiction,\nbut when I backed her up in saying this was also my understanding of podcasts somebody corrected me and said, the very oldest podcasts weren’t that at all. The very oldest podcasts were. More like works of fiction ongoing serial dramas and stuff like\nthat. Which I realized,\nTris: am not sure that either, point is correct. I think podcasts have always been just like books, fiction and nonfiction.\nRobin: right. Quite possibly there presumably was a first podcast. It would be quite\ninteresting to know what that was.\nTris: It would be. I’ve never even thought about that.\nRobin: typey, typey, typey,\nTris: typey, sounds of, uh, mechanical keyboard clicking,\nRobin: Oh yeah, your keyboard I don’t have a keyboard like yours. This is why you have a keyboard like yours\nTris: interesting.\nIt looks like the first podcast came on tape and was a 1989, radio program distributed on cassettes. That does feel like how, podcasts are distributed, except we’ve got MP3s nowadays.\nRobin: Yeah. Wow.\nOh, that’s really cool.\nTris: prefer podcasts, not just because I’m a kind of an audio person. I started out my creative career. So to speak was that I’ve always loved music and so audio is very natural for me two years ago my astonishing and terrifying on YouTube made me a Reluctant video producer, but the format is garbage I suppose it’s YouTube’s fault really The whole process is much less friendly much more superficial.\nRobin: Is it less\nempowering?\nTris: Yeah, you can’t edit what you’ve uploaded. Subscribers won’t necessarily see your videos. The story of YouTube is a story of Lower and lower empowerment for the people creating and watching it.\nBut I will accept their money. And the enormous reach, that the platform, has given me, No complaints there, of course. It is a garbage platform, however. But I think you have to have a garbage platform to accept the benefits of a garbage platform, which is they will put your content in front of people who want to see it.\nWhereas with a podcast, you’ve got nothing. You’ve got an RSS feed, and that’s it.\nRobin: But you can have huge success with it. Obviously people have,\nTris: You certainly can. It’s much more word of mouth, which seems much nicer if you recommend a podcast to your friend That’s the only way it can work.\nRobin: Yeah. I love podcasts for that reason. I think what you were saying about audio versus video is that you feel like the amount of depth of control that you get and, it’s this really rich format. And I feel like that, that also goes with the control you have in, understanding your software and being a geek that likes, likes to configure things.\nAnd that’s also the other real strength of podcasts because they have resisted, the enshittification of all these other mediums. Podcasts are a standout success the world over. And they are not under anyone’s control.\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: And it’s quite amazing. Like in the modern world where everything is monopolized, it is really quite astonishing that\npodcasts exist\nTris: Yes, it’s wonderful as our dark forces at work to stop that you’ve heard of audible originals\nRobin: I don’t know that I have.\nTris: It is a marketing thing that Amazon do, where they say we’ve paid a huge amount of money to these celebrities and they’re making an Audible original podcast. What that means is an exclusive podcast because they want to make the walls of their ward garden higher.\nRobin: Absolutely.\nTris: Same with Apple and the same with Spotify.\nSpotify are the last of the game, but there are, Spotify exclusives. And they are not on any other platform.\nRobin: The most famous Spotify exclusive for a while was Joe\nRogan.\nBut it failed. Joe Rogan published exclusively for Spotify for, I don’t know, like a year or something. And then, didn’t renew.\nIt wasn’t working. The interesting thing about those stories is yes, they are all trying to do it. Every one of these monopolies wants to steal podcasting and put it in a walled garden. But none of them are particularly successful. Like, I hadn’t really heard of Audible Originals.\nI’m probably an anomaly. I automatically knee jerk react against using Amazon products and stuff like that. So, I’m not representative of most people, it’s clearly not succeeding in monopolizing anything,\nI don’t think.\nTris: It’s wonderfully democratic. And I think we have, to shout out, Aaron Schwartz, the creator of RSS, the late and great. Aaron Schwartz for making such a, an incredible simple system that just spread like wildfire before anyone could lock it down. think the huge success of RSS really helped get ahead of these corporations.\nRobin: absolutely, yeah, oh Aaron Schwartz, I’m always so sad, it’s such a generational thing, isn’t it? It really ages me. It kind of like I’m I mean ages in the sense of like you can tell my age by the fact that I’m so triggered by the name Aaron Schwartz because it was such a thing of our\ngeneration.\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: which probably means a lot of the\nlisteners might not know what we’re talking\nTris: In one of my videos where I mentioned RSS, I put a half second slide with a whole bunch of texts being very angry, not super angry, but like telling people to go find out what happened and don’t forget.\nthe Wikipedia page for Aaron Schwartz tells you everything you need to know. A real shame,\n[00:11:02] From Podcasting to Blogging\nRobin: You were talking about your enthusiasm for podcasting. I think I have always had a fascination and an enthusiasm for writing,\nbut I’ve never really managed to Properly inhabit it. I’ve always been so like, something. So scared of it or something. Maybe it’s too big for me. And I’ve always procrastinated So I do have a blog where I’ve published, hundreds of articles, over many years, but that amounts to like a few a year and that is pathetic output. And I wouldn’t say any of them are particularly impressive works people are welcome to check it out.\nI am very much looking forward to exploring. How I could engage myself with, my genuine interests having better output, a better connection between what I’d really like to say, or do, or what I’d enjoy expressing and, actually noting it down somewhere making an impact.\nI think the fact that you’re so prolific at that. I really appreciate it because it’s I think if I could learn any, like a fraction of what you do, I think I would really,\nit would make a big difference to\nTris: Well, It is a lot easier writing fiction than it is writing nonfiction. I think that there are some components, some building blocks of fiction and nonfiction that are, different. I write both, nonfiction videos and fiction podcasts and when I sit down to write my 400.\nWords every morning for lost terminal. Those words just flow out of my fingers because I don’t have to look anything up. I’m inventing it completely whole cloth. The world is completely up to me. You know, it’s still our world, but it’s set in the future, so there are some physical constraints.\nI’m able to just write things, whatever the characters say, it all comes from creative writing. Whereas when I’m writing a script for a video, there’s a lot of back and forth. There’s a lot of checking of figures, copying of code, making sure that I’m right, and getting all of the little details right.\nIn non fiction, that slows you down, compare Stephen King’s output to the output of somebody writing in the non fiction space.\nRobin: Some people write business books incredibly fast. Don’t\nthey?\nTris: but\nRobin: you’ve got Cory Doctorow, who is worth bringing up because he’s very much in the\nspace around Aaron Schwartz\nAnd also, you know, we’ve referenced enshittification but he publishes new articles. Daily, basically, as far as I’m aware I feel like there is a way to do nonfiction, which is where if you tell it as a story, even though it’s nonfiction, if you can figure out how to tell a story. That doesn’t make, possibly false claims.\nIt only talks about, themes that you already know to be true. I think it’s possible, especially as you get older, you get more experienced and you have, you are a genuine expert in things. It is perfectly possible, to stay within the space where the truths you hold are truths.\nYou don’t need to spend a lot of time finding sources\nfor them.\nDoes that make\nsense?\nTris: I think you might have changed my mind. I’m not familiar with writing non fiction as much as I am familiar with writing fiction. Perhaps this unfamiliarity\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: It means that I’ve not figured out, because you’re right, Corey writes so much stuff\nconstantly.\nSo perhaps the problem is between my keyboard and my chair.\nRobin: I think that’s partly because Corey is probably first a storyteller\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: I’ve never really done fiction. I fall into exactly what you’re saying. I start to try to write and I’m getting better at it, but it used to be the case.\nAnd it still is to some extent that I would start to try and write a thesis effectively about, something that I thought was really true and really important. Then I would second guess myself on every, few words and I would have to go off and find verifiable sources draw them together and then reword and made sure that I’d chosen the exact accurate word.\ndescribe the reality that I’ve now, spent the last half hour researching. And it’s you’re right. It’s actually impossible to produce a whole article that way. There’s no time. But I think I’ve got better. I’ve very slowly over many years honed my ability to lean into the story a little bit more and let go of the anxiety about accuracy,\nTris: I think my detractors would say that’s how I write my videos, not worrying too much about accuracy. And they are not wrong in many instances.\nYou’re here listening to my opinion about these languages or whatever. That only takes you so far. And I’m learning more to do due diligence.\nRobin: Your videos are well sourced, and you do the errata thing as well, which is very responsible, they are broadly, like, very reliable and good sources of information, but they are also highly opinionated, and so what you’re doing primarily is you’re saying, from my experience, this is my opinion. And so the main story you’re telling is not one that is highly sourced. That bit, the this is my experienced opinion, doesn’t need sources. And that’s why you can, produce a very good video pretty\nquickly.\nTris: Yeah, think you’re exactly right.\nRobin: That’s fascinating. Hopefully, through this, I can find my voice a little bit.\n[00:16:04] What is this podcast all about\nTris: What is this podcast all about? What can the listeners expect from you and I?\nRobin: Yeah, when you, pitched this to me. I don’t know if you pitched it. I think you were like, let’s do a podcast. And I was like, hell yes. But, but what I imagined is that, we would get to talk about all of the things that we argue about, argue is a strong word that we talk about in real life, which I always find really fascinating.\nI think the way that we, the way that we refine, what’s the correct, understanding of a particular topic. It’s just really fun. I’ve always really enjoyed it with you. And I think that’s, what I immediately knew that we would be doing in a podcast like this. And that’s the sort of way that I’ve always wanted to express myself to the world.\nAs this is my truth of how I understand things, that’s the thing that I want to share.\nTris: right there are enough podcasts in the world of two bros agreeing with each other and not challenging each other enough. Just a lot of agreements like The listener probably agrees with them, they probably agree with each other, and it’s just a lot of quite surface level stuff.\nWhereas, when you and I talk, I find that we disagree a lot about things we generally agree about, and doing that allows us to get to the heart of things, get to the centre of things, decapsulate it, perhaps. We should just, talk to the Oxford Dictionary, see if they can just, like, get this word in.\nI’m sure they’ll listen to us.\nRobin: So that’s very interesting. You’re sort of drawing out a kind of USP there, a sort of unique selling point, of our podcast, which is about, a confrontation, like a little more confrontational, not aggressive confrontation, but a little more, back and forth, a little more challenging.\nthan you tend to hear, which is interesting. And I’d be interested to see if we can do it completely civilly, because I do think it’s important to do it completely civilly.\nTris: Yes, I think that is a feature of both our personalities that is very good. We, we can have arguments or discussions about the topic, not about you and me. It’s unpacking the topic. You have to have two sides pulling the threads to figure out what is going on on the inside.\nI don’t want to make the middle ground fallacy where, someone says one thing, someone says the other, probably the middle ground is the same. I know that is not the case. We argue to unamity quite a lot, where you and I finally get on the same page, we figured out a clear, correct definition of what we’re talking about.\nRobin: Yes, that’s right. And that’s what I’m always wanting to do with other people, but I so often find other, I’m not able to find the wavelength with the other person where we can reach that conclusion. It’s always that, we either just drift further and further apart, or they just don’t have the patience to take the time\nto reach the conclusion.\nTris: and our listeners are going to have a huge advantage over us, in that I’m going to be able to edit out all of the and miscommunications, so they get quite a clean version, rather than two people trying to match their parities and get on the same page.\nI very often find in conversation where it’s I’m talking to someone, I know we’re misunderstanding each other. I just want to get to the point where we’re both talking about the same thing. And that’s what the listeners will be able to get. It sounds really great, I wish we could have that for real life.\nRobin: Yeah. I think you and I are pretty good at it. I think we’re both interested finding that, that place. And we naturally, as you say, are not doing, we’re not trying to do ad hominem attacks, right? I think that’s really crucial.\nI think that’s really crucial. I think that’s really in between people in life. Um, people are jumping to this, these ad hominems. They want to, oh, the fact that you have that crazy opinion that I couldn’t possibly agree with means that you are, some kind of messed up monster,\nTris: Right,\nRobin: and once you’re there, there’s no resolution, I don’t think, probably. But,\nTris: I also think that this kind of, this kind of discussion, although it, I worry that it sounds like we’re going to talking about a lot of highbrow, theoretical, sociological, political stuff, but I think this way of approaching deciding a programming package to use, just as useful for incredibly concrete questions.\nBecause the secret of extremely concrete questions is that they’re not concrete. We, as programmers, we have to, at the start of a project, choose various technologies to use. Are we going to use WordPress? Are we going to use Ruby on Rails? Are we going to Just get a square space, a site for this, which, which is the right way to go.\nAre we going to have a completely bespoke thing or are we going to do whatever? And in those discussions, though perhaps to the unassuming listener, they might think, just going to talk about the positives and negatives. Of course, that is not what happens.\nDave, Dave who has only ever used Ruby on Rails, of course wants to use Ruby on Rails. Alice, who’s only ever used Squarespace, only wants to use Squarespace. Like we all bring our biases to the table. So this way of talking, we plan to talk about concrete web technologies or organization methodologies and as well as perhaps some more, psychology, politics or, other\ntopics like that.\nRobin: To me, this is, really central to good engineering. I look at the software industry in my bias, and I see all of these people who believe themselves to be perfectly rational, haven’t realized or confronted Their own bias.\nThey haven’t inspected it. They haven’t considered the idea that they have bias. And they think that there is a perfectly rational meritocratic space where they’re holding on these discussions and coming to these great solutions. But in fact, there’s a class of engineers who, who have amplified voices in the room and other classes of engineers who don’t.\nAnd almost always what happens is that somebody confidently states truth from their perspective and, a vast majority of people who probably somewhat disagree with them don’t have the metal or the, or the power or whatever in the room to say so. And that’s how most engineering decisions are made in my view. So you’re not doing that, everybody thinks they’re doing this rational balancing of pros and cons exercise and they just don’t. aren’t most of the time. And I’ve tried very, very hard in my job and in my practice of software engineering to, really think about the social patterns that enable, that proper expression of the pros and cons all of the possible angles from which Ruby on Rails might be a better choice and the nuance and the different ways in which those strengths might be presented and the fact that each of those weights are very fuzzy, qualitative, quite likely unquantifiable statements that require an empathetic space where you can properly try and inhabit it. What sort of a user is doing this? What are they? What are they going to feel like? Why would they think that the optimization of this particular interface is actually going to make their lives that just feel that bit easier than the optimization of performance over there, right? Like it’s always this fuzzy, difficult space to try and unpick those.\nBut if you can reach a place of empathy and hearing all those points of view, you can, in my view, make the right choice. Do you know what I mean?\nTris: Yes, absolutely.\nThe assumptions came first. And the evidence was inconsequential. I think this is something that is common to the human condition, is that this is my experience of the world, and you trust it by default.\nYour gut instinct just, you know, Drives you around the world and occasionally your brain, you know, your higher brain wakes up and Thinks about things a little bit and wonders about the nature of the self sleep we all have the, this initial reaction.\nAnd then we seek evidence to confirm the initial reaction. And it’s something that I’m trying to work on quite a lot. I’m only really becoming aware of it recently.\nRobin: Yeah. And one of the ways you’re trying to work on it is by, um, having a obstinate and annoying sort of devil’s advocate that you talk\nto\nweekly on\nTris: it.\nReally, I think probably this is, like therapy. So I appreciate, I appreciate that Robin, and obviously your check is in the mail, um, as they say. Therapy is very expensive, I, I appreciate.\nRobin: Oh no, no, my, my services are free actually.\nTris: Well, that’s\njolly\ngood.\nRobin: I don’t charge\n[00:24:26] Blogging\nTris: so you’ve talked a bit about your love of writing and readers who go to your,\nblog, robinwinslow. uk, you’re welcome,\njust give me those advertising dollars after the show, thanks, we’ll see, dozens, hundreds are there?\nHow much have you written, Robin? I’m scrolling through now, and it is astonishing,\nRobin: It’s probably hundreds, but it’s such a low, speed of output. It’s over a very long time. And they jump all over the place. I probably should, uh, go through and Find the ones that I am most proud of and surface them up. That would be quite helpful.\nTris: yeah, like on YouTube, when you’re a channel admin, you can feature one video for new viewers to show on the channel page. And you can show a separate video for returning viewers. You don’t have to do this, I’m just telling you for interest. Here’s the one you show to new people.\nWhat is this all about? Why should I care? And the returning one can be a bit quirkier, which is quite interesting. Again, I don’t know if that is possible on your, static site generator. What I wanted to talk to you about is that you said you find it difficult to maintain focus\nwhen writing.\nI sympathize. Happens to me all the time. And also I\nnote that it’s been a while since you’ve\nwritten anything on the blog.\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: they\nlinked? What’s been going on there? Maybe I can help.\nRobin: It certainly is linked. I have a lot of things. I’ve always been overflowing with ideas of what I could write.\nBut the only things I’ve ever successfully written have been written in one\nsitting. I don’t think I’ve ever really Successfully written something and then come back and edit it the next day\nor the next week\nTris: Oh, that is an ADHD mood, isn’t it?\nRobin: yeah.\nSo either I write it and I publish it or I write it and it goes in a back drawer forever. I don’t know that I mind only writing and publishing stuff in one sitting. Actually some of the people I really respect are people who seem to just throw thought pieces up, immediately.\nEvery, they’ll have a thought on a day and just throw it up. I think I’d quite like that, I’d to be able to just be like, okay, here’s the thought, publish, done. I’d probably also like\nan outlet where I’m crafting significant works of writing. I think the thing that I’ve always felt would really help me there was like a writing, group. Or like buddies, like somebody who somewhere where I’d feel something of a commitment to this community to be doing my work and helping them with their work. And I thought that would help me.\nTris: I think so. It’s not November yet, but you know about NaNoWriMo.\nRobin: I do. How is it a community? I know it is\na sort\nof community but it feels, personal.\nTris: Yes,\nthat’s the joy and horror of writing, is that you sit in front of the page, and it’s just you and the page. Doesn’t matter, with your loving family around, with all your friends, with people online telling you to, get those 1600\nwords a day for NaNoWriMo. Like, when you sit down, it’s you versus yourself, I suppose. Um, is writing a mental health condition.\nI, oh dear.\nRobin: I’ve always felt one of the good things about writing, is it helps me anchor myself. I think if I did it more,\nI would have more confidence. You’re always saying how I’m.\nSecond guessing my own opinions and stuff like that, and I do, I come in with skepticism about my own position all of the time, and I think that’s actually been quite a limiting, instinct that I have, because to be able to make impact you have to have confidence in something.\nYou have to believe in, you have to, you have to be able to stay on a track, because you believe in yourself, when I write stuff, it helps to make it clear that is my opinion, if I could then, publish it and have, people notice and maybe even be interested or agree.\nThat would help me feel like my thoughts were worth something. I think\nTris: yeah.\nSo I think the NaNoWriMo forums and movement, tries to bring in a little bit of that. Because you’ve got encouragement, which is nice on one side, but can be a double edged sword. And you’ve also got. Accountability, and I think it is the accountability that really works for me because I never do anything unless I’m accountable for it.\nI think this is a big ADHD mood, let me know what you think. The deadline doesn’t matter until it’s in my face and I either put pen to paper virtually now or I am going to fail. So I’m suddenly accountable. I’m not accountable yesterday, but I was accountable today because the deadline is midnight.\nIt happens a lot with university students, but it continues through life with people with ADHD. Certainly it happened with me. Though I have completed NaNoWriMo once, Oh, I, it’s 1600 a lot. I don’t do that for anything. I do 400 a day for Lost Terminal.\nIt makes you accountable because you’ve got this deadline every single day. It’s granular, it taught me there are granular deadlines. I’ve got to do 600\nwords today. It\ndoesn’t matter about tomorrow. it doesn’t matter what I did yesterday.\nJust keep on going. That taught me a very important\nlesson. I\nwonder if it would be a useful framework for you to think about.\nRobin: I think it would be useful. The other thing I struggle with is, creating space in my day to\nsit down and do this stuff.\nTris: You’re\nRobin: know.\nTris: fair enough.\nRobin: You say that. But if you want space for anything, you have to create it. I don’t think that’s necessarily\ndifferent. Yes,\nIt probably needs to be done a bit more deliberately when you\nare a father, when you have significant demands on your time. But ultimately it’s true anyway, I think, and you’re very good at it. You have the things that you want to do and you make sure that you’ve scheduled them in and you’ve created the space I need to do the same. I don’t know that, I guess I wouldn’t even know whether once I sit down and say, okay, now I’ve got an hour to do some writing.\nWhether I would succeed because I’ve never done that.\nTris: A quote by Neil Gaiman, he says to be a writer is very simple. You sit down and put one word in front of the other until it is done. It is that simple and that hard. And that is how I think about writing.\nI never found timeboxing working for me. I’m trying to put tasks into my day and schedule them by hour or blocks it’s not really working. What does work for me with writing, is a word count limit per day.\nI schedule that, between seven and nine is my writing time. That is a legacy from when I worked the programming mines every day as a salaried programmer, because I had to do all my writing before work. That is the best time for me, because after work, I’m too tired, and even if I’m not tired, my brain is full of the things it, during the day, it’s full of sprint planning meetings, encapsulated objects, networking, and all kinds of nonsense, what I want to do is wind down, I don’t want to be creative, I can’t be creative, I’m most creative, after I’ve woken up, which is this slot.\nAnd so I have the slot where I sit in front of my machine and I have this small, really small, 400 words it’s a page for this 400 words to do and that is the only way I could do things. Lost Terminal the first season was not like this. It was exactly as you’ve described. I have to publish it in one sitting.\nOr I have to write it and finish it in one sitting. So that’s how I wrote the first episode, in a fugue state, after I’d listened to, Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor’s podcast, Start With This. I got about five episodes in, and I was like, oh my god, I have to make something. And it was really inspiring.\nI’ll put the link in the show notes. It’s really fantastic. We certainly must talk about Start With This at another point. I’m going to make a note of that, Start With This. I just, in a fugue state, wrote the whole first episode. And then I did the same for the second episode and the third.\nI had to do things all in one sitting. The first season is really short for that reason. Once the first season took off. I had some patrons, people were giving me really great feedback. Only like five, this wasn’t a wild success right off the bat.\nThat was four years ago and I have about 250 patrons now, which is wonderful, but the progress is linear. There was never an explosion and it was quite slow and methodical, which at the time felt disheartening. You can’t look into the future at your possible success because that doesn’t really exist yet.\nAnd, so Season 2, I learned to be a real\nwriter and started taking one week to write an episode. Split over 400 words a day. That really worked for me. I don’t know if that helps you.\nRobin: I think it would help. I think you’re right. Being like, this is my word limit. And I’m more\nlikely to do,\nwhat I\nnaturally do, which is decide That I, haven’t finished yet and steal moments here and there to do the thing. So that might work.\nI also, like your idea of doing it before work in the morning, although sometimes I’m inspired by things during the day that make me want to, write stuff.\nTris: The way I think about when to write, I don’t know if you’ve thought about the best time for you, but the best time for me is morning. I think me and Salvador Dali think the same on this regard, is that I, and maybe this is why it might be different for you, is that I’m writing fiction.\nI am creating out of nothing, out of just my brain, everything that happens. I don’t have to do any research. I don’t have to, look up anything.\nAt least not for the creation part of it. It’s not synthesis. It’s pure fiction, pure creation. Dali found himself most creative When he just woke up he would sit in a chair with a bunch of keys in his hand over a metal plate and have a nap, just as his eyes close and he goes into that nap, he drops the keys, you know, sleeping, so his hand opens and he drops the keys in his sleep, crashes into the metal plate and wakes him up, then he goes to the easel and starts painting.\nDali’s amazing, we’ve actually got a Dali print in my parents house that my mum dumpster dived from a\nskip in the area that Dali lived. Someone was just demolishing a house and mum was going, walking past it, looked in and was like, oh, there’s a signed print of Dali in here that the builders have thrown out.\nI guess I’ll have that. So there we go. Now she has a signed Dali\nprint. When I\nwake up, I feel like I’m focused because I’ve not yet read Hacker News, I’ve not yet read Reddit, I’ve not yet watched any YouTube\nvideos, my mind is as fresh as it’s gonna\nbe.\nRobin: I think it could work. The problem is I don’t go to bed early enough. I think if I went to bed early, then getting up early would be much more of an option.\nTris: Did you find that things settled down a bit with ADHD meds? Do you mind\ntalking about that?\nRobin: Oh, no, I don’t mind talking about it at all.\nI’ve definitely been on the meds and stayed up\nvery, very late. To start with, I felt kind of wired into the evening.\nSo I thought the meds were still doing something\nand that’s not true anymore. Now I’m really exhausted by 10 at night. I basically think that the sleep thing and the meds are not exactly related. I had a more organized day, but nonetheless I get into the evening and there’s something that’s keeping me up.\nthey call it revenge bedtime procrastination. Yes. So I’m trying to get revenge on the world or myself or something. That feels very accurate to me. It’s also a shame\nand fear thing for some reason. Lately, like last week or so, I feel on top of it.\nTris: Aw.\nRobin: The meds are fantastic, and knew that most recently because I’d run out, and had four or five days without any. Got my 70, which is the high dose I’ve gone on to. And then I took it and the difference between that day and the previous day was so stark, so stark,\nTris: Hey, are we, 70mg elvanse buddies?\nRobin: we are, we’re exactly that.\nYes.\nTris: Aw. That’s nice. Yeah. That’s the level that worked for me as well. When I don’t take, I do intentionally not take them now and then. Very often at a lazy Saturday. day or a lazy Sunday or sometimes both,\nJust to kind of reset and check,\ndo I still need to take these?\nAnd it is very obvious that I do because I’m like. Oh No, this is what\nit was like. No, no, no, no, no. I can’t go back. This is no good. I need the good\nbrain chemicals.\nRobin: My wife’s been encouraging me to see what kind of services there are for more like ADHD counseling,\nBecause obviously there’s two different ways that you can tackle ADHD.\nYou can have the\nmedication and you can have, more like management techniques, ideally you’re doing both, but I don’t know all that much about the management techniques side. Like I definitely know some things and I’ve obviously got my own coping mechanisms that I had. before anyway. And I think quite a lot of those are quite helpful and I’ve got quite a lot of techniques, but, I still think there could be a hell of a lot more to learn. And I, think that would be good for me. So that’s another thing I’m going to be exploring\nTris: oh, interesting.\nRobin: know when exactly.\nTris: I’ve never, explored that avenue because luckily for me, I just needed the meds and then my existing coping mechanisms were working a little better I’m building all my own and I think about this all the time I’ve got a little bit more space to optimize my systems.\nI don’t have a family and a full time job. I’m just living the dream of a writer who can closet myself somewhere and keep on writing some of my writing is, to myself, about thinking about how my systems should work. When you have,\nThose sessions, I would love to talk to\nyou about it in a future episode.\nTalking about mechanisms for being productive seems completely on topic for what I imagine this show to be.\nRobin: Absolutely. No, of course I will be very happy\nto talk about that. I don’t know if they’re\nproductivity. I I see them as more.\nMacro psychological things than productivity itself. Over time, I have learned that,\nPossibly the biggest value that I can produce is in, confidently communicating my attitude to certain problems.\nI can see places where. things need solving and where a completely different way of thinking about the way to solve that or a well targeted best practice or a, process flow change, would make a big difference. Fortunately, I seem to be in a job where there’s a lot of opportunity for those sorts of things, and they’re incredibly valuable.\nThat means that, what’s required of me is not extended periods of focused, hard work. Instead, it leans into this meandering, Exploratory process that I think I have which means that I can see these opportunities and make good suggestions for them So that works quite well for me\nTris: Excellent, yeah. I look forward to talking about that at some point in the future.\n[00:38:30] Writing Disctractions\nTris: I would like to talk, if I may, about writing distractions. You mentioned that it’s very easy to get knocked out of the flow when you go and research something. Now, you’re predominantly doing non\nfiction and I’m predominantly doing fiction, so I’ve got a lot more that I\ncan just get into the flow\nand forget about because it’s all invented.\nBut it must be much more difficult with non fiction.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. So that does happen to me all the time. I think what happens is\nI’ll start writing where I’ve had some confidence, like I started\nwith some confidence about, this is my\nposition and this is what I want to say. And then as I’m writing it, I sort of realized that something that I’m claiming is not necessarily self evident, right?\nUm,\nand so then I need to immediately, I start trying to work out how to shore up my argument. Either I rephrase and rephrase and rephrase a few times. Or I go off and I start trying to read something to just make sure I’m like, oh yes, actually there’s this whole discipline here and maybe I didn’t explore that properly and it’s actually very relevant here.\nSo I suppose I’m thinking, always when I’m writing, I’m thinking of criticism of my writing. So I’m anticipating what people might, how people might come and tear down what I’m trying to say. And so then I realized that there’s this whole thing that needs to be read or researched or I need to go find all these links and I go off and I do that.\nAnd that tends to then, as soon as I’m off surfing the web,\nTris: Oh yeah, um, yeah, I get lost. I fall off the wave,\nI cannot imagine how people write inside a web browser. Like people who are writing directly into Google Docs, say, that means you have a web browser open. A tab is just a click away. I personally could not survive that environment. The way I write is by deleting everything. I even remove the browser on my machine, a topic for another time, but when I am in the writing mode, I don’t even have a browser installed.\nYou can do this with multiple user accounts or different devices, but I’m on NixOS, so I can do all kinds of weird stuff. And, because I just don’t trust myself. But there are places, even in fiction, just like with your, that you, just like in, in nonfiction, there are places where I have to be right about\nthings.\nHistorical things need to be correct, dates need to be correct, and even\nwhat you’ve mentioned about arguments and wanting to be correct, and presenting things correctly,\nthat of course happens in fiction as well, especially in science fiction, which is where I’m mostly writing in\nlost terminal.\nRobin: That did occur to me when you were saying earlier that because you’re writing fiction, you didn’t need to check stuff or something like that. You were saying that you didn’t get interrupted so often. I was thinking about the fact\nthat you’ve obviously come to our shared chat group and with things like, I was thinking of writing about this, what’s a good example of a sort of technology or something.\nCause obviously you do need to do research for that. There’s a lot of research that goes into credible fiction as well.\nTris: I’m glad you brought up our Telegram group. I would never have started that conversation in the morning. For me, mornings are on Do Not Disturb mode. And for huge sections of the morning, as I said, I don’t even have a web browser available. One of the reasons that I’ve standardized on Telegram other platforms would work if they had this one feature.\nScheduled messages. It is vital for me to be able to have a thought in the morning, let’s say 7. 30, and maybe I need to send a message to you about, oh, are we still on for the recording of of the podcast, later on. But if I send that to you, you might reply and ask me questions, and then I’m in a conversation.\nSo what I do, I think this is the first time I’m telling you this, What I do is I schedule a message for like 11. 30 or 12 o’clock or something like that, if that makes sense for the message, with my question. And so it’s captured, it’s going to send, and as far as my brain is concerned, I’ve already asked you the question, and it’s out of my mind.\nAnd then, I go back to writing, and I’m not distracted by your answer. Because even if I’m on Do Not Disturb, I might see your message and I might have a quick little look, which is risky. Having a glance at a browser or a messenger, super risky. So, scheduled messages, and indeed email, which works nicely because it’s, it doesn’t notify you.\nIf you turn off notifications, which you should do, it’s just a very asynchronous thing, I can move things along, but this is, I have a generalized solution for this that I think might work for you and maybe it might work for our listeners. The generalized case is to have modes of, modes of working, modes of thinking, modes of operating.\nAnd those modes progress throughout the day. And they always happen the same. For my day, I’ve got about five modes separated about linearly throughout the day. A writing mode, a research mode, a bit more of an online research mode, and then a discussion mode, and then at the end of the day I’ve got a sort of a relaxing gaming, or socializing mode.\nAnd what I do. Is I push tasks to a future mode. I’m gonna stop calling them modes. These are contexts, because I’m using the GTD terminology here, the contexts, so research tasks when I’m writing, I need to know this date, I need to know this time. I need to know this fact.\nAnd if I open a browser. I’m done or I could be done because Wikipedia is fascinating and I can always lie to myself and say, I’m looking up networking protocols from 1976. That’s actually on topic for what I’m doing, but it’s not really. It’s very easy to lie to ourselves about things that are tangentially related.\nSo what I do is I make a new task for myself, write down what I’m going to do, look up this date, look up whatever, and then I tag it with. The future context I want to pick it up in. Now you’ll note that this is very similar to sending a scheduled message that, that then runs at a certain time. This is that, but for me.\nSo my first two modes are the chamber, which is where the writing happens. It’s a very fancy name because I’m a very fancy person. And the second mode is called library, which is where research happens. Research but no chatting, no browser, or rather no general purpose browser. I use a separate browser that doesn’t have YouTube logged in, it’s got everything blocked, that sort of thing.\nIf I’m writing\nsomething,\nand I\nneed to think of something, I write in a\nlittle to do, and I tag it, library, and then I\nkeep writing, I keep the flow\ngoing. That\ngeneralized case works for my whole\nday.\nRobin: There are things about your process that I’m, that I’ll find very useful. And in fact, I think you might’ve been the person that really introduced me properly to the concept of scheduled messages.\nAnd I have made, I have made, significant use of\nscheduled messages since I realized how powerful they could be because they are in more and more places.\nI can schedule emails in Outlook. I can schedule,\num, I can\nschedule messages in\nSlack. In, for work, and it’s really the scheduled messages in Slack that I’ve used\nmost.\nRobin: And I do use them in that very way, I know I want to say this thing to this person, but I don’t want to say it now because it will start this whole conversation and I don’t want to, now’s not the time for the conversation.\nSo I definitely do that. I think there’s a big difference between you and me broadly in this kind of regimented organizational space because I’m,\nI don’t think I can be organized in that way. I think I will always immediately react against it. I need to have a lot of techniques that are at my disposal that I’m practiced enough to be good at so that any moment I can work out how to use them dynamically to manage myself better. But I can’t, I don’t think, say, Okay, I’m going to have this designed context, and I’m going to switch into that context, and now I’m in that context, and I’m going to stay there. And now I’m moving into this other context, and now I’m going to stay there. I don’t think I can do that. That’s not going to work for me.\nTris: Fair enough. It’s a very weird way of, working and I’m still learning how to make it work for me. But, so you, you need to solve the problem then of what happens when\nyou run out of time. You\nsaid earlier that you can, you tend to only be able to publish\nstuff that you write and finish in\none sitting.\nBut that is incompatible with being, with regular writing, it seems to me. Is that something you want to improve?\nRobin: I think I need to figure out how to\nnot just do that.\nI need to, I think the structure of my life\nis such, I think that the bit that’s harder to change\nand possibly impossible to\nchange is the fact that I’m\nunpredictable and my day is unpredictable.\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: And so I think therefore I need mechanisms that accommodate for that.\nAnd so writing wise as well, I need to somehow find a hook that allows me to. Pick up to continue a thread over, over a couple of sittings, which makes more sense to the way that I think generally, because I am a big fan of asynchronicity. I just need a thing to pull me back into it.\nThat’s what’s missing. What happens is I have a thought and I’m very enthusiastic about this idea.\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: And then I. I get started on it, something happens, and I drift off, and I’ve completely lost the thread. In the emotional sense, I’ve completely lost the thread of that obsession,\nAnd now it’s gone.\nAnd all I need is something that keeps a line back to that thought, that topic, that,\nThat obsession.\nTris: This happens in discussion. I dream of some imaginary system that keeps track of all the subjects in a discussion with friends. Because you sort of get forked off on one topic and then maybe you’ll come back to the first topic or maybe you’ll fork to a third topic and it spreads out like a tree and I might be very excited by number two and I’ve got a reply to number two and I want to add to the conversation and I’m thinking about it.\nBut then, oh no, the conversation is forked to subject\nthree. And I’m also excited by that and I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say for subject two.\nUh, sorry, your description gave me PTSD because this is how it’s like in every conversation I’m\nin. The answer, I think, maybe for both of us might be note taking or outlining\nRobin: When you’re talking about it with the conversations, I think note taking is that is very powerful. And I do, I’ve,\nWhen you and I were having a\nconversation live in, in, in Meatspace,\nIn London, you got out your, is it a remarkable? I’m not quite sure.\nTris: is, yep, best tablet. Right. Exactly.\nRobin: And you were taking notes and, I, I knew immediately why you were doing it and I think it worked very well and I would like to do something similar and that’s very helpful,\nbut that doesn’t\nexactly work for the writing\nthing. I don’t think, because obviously the notes are already there, because\nthey are the, what I wrote,\nbut I don’t quite know how to yeah, attach myself back to the thing. If I had a,\nif I had a partner, this is why I feel like I need other people.\nBecause if I had somebody else, that, that cared about it, then I would immediately, that, that would draw me back into it, and then I’d have no trouble.\nTris: Like pair programming. It’s much more focused when you’re working with a pair\nRobin: Exactly. Yes. All of the ways in which I have thought about good ways to program It’s\nfunny, isn’t it?\nI now realize are, me\ntrying to design coping strategies for my ADHD. And I think a lot of the software industry is, I think there’s so many things, even to the point of the features that get implemented in devices, things like dark mode and not just that, there was another big one that I was thinking of recently.\nTris: Like collapsing a sidebar maybe get that out of my I\nRobin: maybe, yeah, like I feel like there’s a, it was quite clear to me when I thought about a couple of different features that I’ve forgotten, but if they come back to me I’ll mention them, but that they were designed from quite a specific sort of psychological experience. Do you see what I mean?\nTris: I do this there is a point in devin price’s book unmasking autism that I think applies to\nADHD as well as autism he says very confidently and matter of\nfactly that the internet was created By and for autistic\npeople.\nRobin: Yes.\nTris: And though that is a large sweeping statement, I can see what he’s saying there.\nRobin: Yes. And it’s interesting that is denobias. And it means that we’ve built a global system that isn’t designed for everybody.\nTris: Possibly. I think there is a larger term for it. discussion about whether affordances for people with autism and disabilities actually often benefit everyone. Like ramps are great for everyone, not just for people in wheelchairs. I think it’s, that’s how I think about\nthe affordances for people with autism and ADHD, because if you can hide the\nsidebar, then that’s great for people with ADHD who’d be distracted by it, especially if there’s like notifications and stuff in there.\nBut actually, Even if you don’t have ADHD you\nmight want to hide the sidebar for numerous reasons,\nRobin: So that’s absolutely true. And I don’t want to also minimize the fact that there is a lot that’s not accessible or in tech all\nover the\nplace. And it’s horrible. And I discovered\nrecently something that I hadn’t Even\nthought of. I just saw this thing on\nmastodon of somebody complaining about captures and about how,\nCaptures are broadly not compatible with the screen reader.\nAnd so If you’re blind, and you encounter like anything where you encounter a capture, you’re just suddenly stuck. A lot of the time. And that was something that’s such a huge thing that I hadn’t occurred to me. I’m sure there are accessible ways to deal with that and they must have been implemented, but\nTris: Yes, very often you’ll find a capture has a speak button. I have\na play button that where you can hear the capture, but I agree, not every one and maybe not most of them.\nRobin: Exactly. I have no idea the proportion. I only discovered this morning, so I haven’t looked into it. But,\nbut yeah, No. So I don’t want to minimize\nthat. That’s\nabsolutely true. And I’m not claiming that,\nNeurodivergent people. Are broadly accommodated well by, the web in any sense. But I do think if you look at it and you look at some of those features, it’s not that they don’t help everybody. They do, but by spending effort there, you’re all, there’s always an opportunity cost, right?\nYou’re always not spending effort somewhere else. And so the sum of all of the places where you’ve chosen to spend effort represents a huge opportunity cost of stuff that you haven’t therefore spent effort\non. And I feel a bit like that might well be the case That software broadly, even in the things that we design, that have been quite, that we all think are a good thing, is skewed quite significantly towards a particular sort of person that’s overrepresented within The software industry. And I find that quite fascinating. And I also feel I’ve come to these conclusions about really good ways to run teams and all this kind of thing, and I think they’re really effective. And I haven’t seen any evidence that’s not true. I think my ideas are quite good ones, but they almost certainly are a lot more biased than I realized. Towards the fact that I’m trying to accommodate for my own psychological habits and assuming that they are general. When they’re probably not as general as I think they are.\nTris: I think that’s a very good introspection. Maybe I think\nthat, designing things for autistic people would benefit everyone because I am autistic. Yes, how would I know? How would I know otherwise? I,\nRobin: so I don’t know what you do about that. It’s trying to have a good diversity within the\ncommunity, isn’t it? Ideally demographically, everybody would be represented Roughly equally within equally to like their proportion in society, or something like that.\nI’m not quite sure but it’s an example of of how that how that lands.\n[00:53:23] Bottom-up Thinking\nTris: I think what this podcast is going to be is a large, wide discussion of our interests, which includes, but not limited to tech, internet, the tools that you would use in a. digital information world to project management to do Note taking that sort of thing.\nI’m certainly very interested in those and as well as Things that are tangentially related to our lives. I’ve got videos on non standard sleep systems non standard learning methods DIY computing I’ve got a lot of thoughts about AI and art and that sort of thing. But that’s only looking backwards at what I’ve talked about before.\nI imagine way more scope for us to talk about the many different layers of things that I’m interested in. I’m also excited for the other 50%, which is your contribution, what you’re interested in.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. So I think that’s a great summary. I think that is exactly what we’re trying to do. We’re trying to focus on the things we’re interested in, and we’re both interested in, understanding and defining those things that we care about as truthfully as we can, together, right? And that’s what this is about.\nI realized as you were talking about those different systems, like the way that it’s coding and the way that people might try and organize their lives. When we’re talking about all of those topics, for me, I suppose, one way or another, I always think about them as socio technical systems.\nAs in, I always think about all these things as like an interaction between. Atomic actors, and I sort of graph them in my head and try and see all the ways in which they subtly pull on each other, and that sort of thing. I’m interested in any space where I can.\nDo that sort of interrelational analysis. Do you know what I mean? I don’t know if that’s helpful, I think in technical systems, this is obvious because these interactions are explicit And then when it comes to organizational systems, it’s the same for me because there’s all these different instincts that are pulling the self in different directions.\nAnd then you’ve got all these different techniques that interact with each other and have feedback mechanisms. And it’s the same in politics. It’s the same in groups of, how humans choose to group themselves in the world. My Master’s was Interactive Systems Design, and I think it must have been somewhere around the time I did my Master’s that I started to use this as a pattern for interpreting the world at large, and now I just enjoy seeing all sorts of things in the world as some version of these systems.\nSociotechnical systems.\nTris: I didn’t know that was your master’s, that’s very interesting. I wonder if maybe we could summarize our different approaches to things. I wonder if we could summarize our approaches to unpacking these topics as a little more top down and a little more bottom up, where I’m, I look at things very much from the bottom up.\nWould that be a good ? Rule of thumb?\nRobin: I think I do, look at things top down. As in, I see, I think I prefer to draw things down to It’s difficult to say exactly what top down and what bottom up mean. But I think for me, I see things as having certain foundational properties. That then influence the shape of everything around them.\nAnd I’m always trying to draw out those foundational properties so that we can better understand how everything else is oriented by those.\nTris: There is something to be said for the bottom up approach of getting all your ducks in a row, getting all of the data discovered. rather than a top down approach. This was something that I, researched and talked about in my autism video. I’m sure the listeners probably know that I’m autistic.\nYou certainly do. And I think all my friends certainly do. The behavioral patterns that we see in people with autism are varied and sometimes contradictory. But\na very common trait is bottom up thinking. And I got this from the book, Unmasking Autism, by Dr. Devon Price, I highly recommend it, if you haven’t read it already,\nRobin: I haven’t read it.\nTris: Half of my video’s research was inspired by the revelations in that book, I thought I knew everything about my condition, and then, Devon was like, here’s all the things.\nA bottom up approach to life was inspired by, by unmasking autism. Devon was really nice and ruined my life because I was ready to publish, I was gonna do it on Monday. He replied to my inquiry email on Friday saying, Sorry I missed your email, I hardly ever use email.\nYes, I’d be delighted for you to feature my book. Here is a PDF, please don’t share it. I hadn’t based any of my video on any of his work, though I had heard of his book.\nObviously, I’d emailed him. Anyway, I read it over the weekend, and after the first chapter, I was like, oh no, I have to rewrite my entire video because this is so good. The first chapter of information was so amazing. So I rewrote my video on Saturday, and then that Saturday evening, I read chapter two.\nAnd I was like, oh no, I have to rewrite my video again. And so Sunday I rewrote it again, but I’d learned my lesson, I finished the book. And so then over the next two weeks, there was so much more to learn and so much more detail, like, it’s all very well writing about programming, making a video about programming.\nHere’s this cool feature of the language, x, y, z, and you can just look up this information, find it, and it’s good. Even if you can’t find the information online, even if it’s completely novel, you can test out your idea with programming. You can write a program and run it,\nand it’ll either work or it won’t.\nAnd so you’ve got a lot of confidence when writing about\nprogramming, whereas with any mental health condition, absolute nightmare.\nSo this bottom up approach\nreally, really, came from, came from that.\nRobin: Yeah. But I’m not sure that that’s necessarily the same thing as what I’m talking about. I think it’s related\nTris: Oh, yeah,\nRobin: obviously,\nthere’s a lot of overlap\nbetween autism and ADHD but I identify with\nthe ADHD\npart and I don’t think I identify with the Autism side of things, particularly, and I don’t think I particularly identify with the bottom up ness because I think a lot of my structures of\nthinking are also top down.\nTris: That’s a very good way of looking at it. Whereas I am autistic and I cannot see things from the top down. a A blessing and a curse in many ways. Ideally you would use both, which you do a lot better than I. So I’m looking forward to hearing, as we all, as ever when talking to you, I’m looking forward to hearing your take on things, your opinion, or looking forward to the conversation that will bring out a better understanding of the topic\nRobin: Yeah, I can’t help thinking though that’s not, that can’t be a perfect description because in a lot of ways, a bottom up approach that you’re describing sounds like it’s much more decomposed and there’s lots more Pieces that are free floating and mine sounds much more anchored because I’m talking about there being foundational things that lead to everything else, but in the way we actually live our lives, it’s the opposite.\nYou’re much better at having. Structure and, routine and, organizational first principles that you actually adhere to. And I am all over the place and quite unstructured and quite, quite chaotic. I feel like in a way that can’t be the, I think it’s one of those things where like you try and describe it this way, but it’s only looks that way from a particular angle.\nYeah,\nif you looked at it from a different angle, it wouldn’t necessarily take that shape. So yeah.\nTris: I agreed, I was just trying to make something similar, something simple for the listeners. In fact, I think I’ve done you a disservice with it. I’m going to redefine my, my, my rule of thumb, my generalization of us, whereas you do top down and bottom up and I only do bottom up. I think that might be as fairer.\nRobin: This is the thing I’m saying that the assumption that you only do bottom up, wouldn’t explain how good you are at, having clear goals and ethical rules and principles that allow you to be incredibly powerful in how you approach life.\nTris: I think it’s, I suppose these, as you say, top down and bottom up don’t really mean anything until we start to define them. And for me. A, writing a book is a top down goal, whereas the habit of sitting and writing 400 words a day is a bottom up habit. So I see these, the things that I’m good at are because of this.\nbottom up way of thinking. If I do this small, low level action and I craft it well enough, then I can build upon it and eventually get to the top, which is where the goal sits, which is me, say, publishing a book.\nRobin: But for that particular example, I think that’s just objectively the better approach. If you can’t write, you can’t write a book by being like, okay, I’m going to write a book now. You have to do the thing you’re talking about. It’s the only way that works.\nTris: You would not believe how many people think that you can write a book that way, and indeed would recommend sitting and letting the muses take you and when you’re bored, stand up and go outside. And then when the muses take you again, go down and do it. I mean, it’s a perfectly reasonable way to do it if it works for you, but I think that only bottom up things work.\nAnd I, That is because I have only tried bottom up things. It is my, one of my biases is that because I think in autistic way, I have only been able to succeed with autistic thinking and autistic actions and therefore the only things that work for me are autistic ways of doing things, which is very easy for me to decide.\nLook, I made a YouTube channel by doing all of these Bottom up, autistic decisions, or behaviours, or whatever. And I did the same with this, and with that, and whatever. But again, there’s no reason for that. They’ve worked for me, and they might work for others. In fact, I think probably. As you say, a lot of things should be bottom up, but the curse of somebody who has autistic traits is that a lot of things should be top down as well.\nAnd if you can’t access that way of thinking as easily, you’re at a bit of a disadvantage.\nRobin: Yes. Yeah. Fair enough. I’m very interested actually at some point, probably not right now in drawing out how much of those things are much more are common to humans, much more broadly than autism. Because it seems to me that the, what I see in you is a lot of very well refined techniques that you need Because you have a particular need of them, which other people might not need quite so keenly.\nBut nonetheless, they are the, for most people, they are the more efficient approach. That’s my belief when it comes to something like that. If you want to be a writer, you have to write 10, 000 words a day. Not maybe 10, 000, you have to write X number of words a day.\nKeep doing that. You will build up and you will turn into something. That thing that, Wow, that was a great quote I heard. I don’t remember, but it was like something about how, every project, every really impressive goal, achievement that anyone has ever has only looks like a really impressive achievement when viewed from a distance.\nWhen viewed up close, it is a thousand tiny things that on their own are not impressive. And, I think that’s just broadly true. And the idea that, it can be created because you intend because you have this strong commitment to this vision to create this huge thing.\nis basically an illusion in people at large, not just in autistic people. Do you know what I mean? But I don’t know how much that’s true, but that’s where I am at the moment.\nTris: I agree. The one of the, when writing about mental health, like I have done for my ADHD and my autism videos, and I hope I will do more in the future, one of the common concerns, or pieces of feedback, is these behaviours that you’re describing and are saying are either ADHD or autism or, some other label, they’re things, they’re behaviours that humans just can do.\nYou’re not, it’s, you’re not flying, you’re not, walking through walls, you’re not doing things that other people can’t do. But The reason that we categorise them in these umbrellas of behaviours, is if they all happen at the same time, or a lot of them are happening, and they’re happening a lot more than usual, we’ve got, what we’ve got here could be this thing that we name autism, or whatever. Yeah, it’s, I forget what that is exactly called, but in my autism video I called it the constellation of behaviours, like one or two stars, like whatever, who knows what’s going on, but. If you get, a whole cluster of them, they might have a shape you recognise, and then you give that shape a name, and there you go.\nI’m very pleased with that metaphor, for autism. I had a, I came up with it when trying to describe it to my dad. I was just, riffing and trying to explain what autism was to this, gent who definitely had autism. And was telling me that all these behaviours were normal because he’d done them his entire life.\nRobin: Yeah, absolutely. I think it’s a really great description as well. I do really think it’s incredibly important for people Not to when it comes to mental health labels, neurodivergent,\neffectively, for people not to take them as.\nA single thing and a bucket and an obvious, a well defined and inflexible description that you can necessarily know exactly what it is, that it’s always a, a slight, skewing of the very normal human experience and all of the individual behaviors are. Also that and so when there’s a collection of them that together, land together in a particular way and to a particular level, then we can try and give them a label and that’s helpful because it is useful to say, Oh, you’re this kind of thing.\nthing, and I’m also this thing, that’s nice. And that, and there’s lots of ways in which you can then have, target appropriate techniques at people that have that collection of characteristics, but they’re not, they’re not something that’ll, that, that, that means you can strongly separate, and I think that’s in the whole, whole of mental health, that, that is true. And that’s super important. And I think so many of the conditions, like extreme conditions, things that people assume they, they go nowhere near, Schizophrenia, right? Psychopathy. People think that they are, like, a completely different class of a person that is, wholly removed from their experience of the world.\nAnd I think it is at all. I think they’re, certain parts of characteristics that you understand just being pushed to, just being more extreme in that person than in you, right? And the way you put it, I think is brilliant.\nTris: Thank you so much.\n[01:07:42] How often?\nTris: robin? How often are we going to record? How often should a podcast like this Be published.\nRobin: I, I’d like to say, show me that it matters,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: because I have podcasts that, Publish multiple times a week that I listen to and podcasts that publish once or twice a month. And I would love it if the ones that publish once or twice a month published more often, but I’ve never considered not listening to them just because they publish infrequently.\nTris: I agree. I’m of the same mind. Although I don’t believe I subscribe to anything that is more often than a week, mostly because I don’t tend to listen to a lot of non fiction. I only listen to perhaps, two or three, three or four. Most of my listening is fiction, sci fi or fantasy or something like that.\nRobin: I think maybe to start with, we should aim for monthly. Because I think to start with, it’s going to be very inefficient. You’re the one that I seems to have mostly taken on the burden of actually trying to cut all our ramblings down into something interesting and palatable.\nAnd I think that, that sounds like a really daunting and mammoth task, and I certainly wouldn’t want to put you under any pressure to do that any quicker than it, than it takes. I think maybe we can target fortnightly as like a pipe dream. If we get all our processes really efficient and we get really practiced at recording, usable stuff most of the time, then I think.\nThen I think fortnightly might be realistic, but I would say to start with, let’s not assume that we can do anything quicker than a month.\nTris: Yes, I would rather have a very high quality thing once a month than something more, reactionary or less well put together, thought out, researched, something like that.\nRobin: Okay, we’ll aim to publish monthly, although I don’t think the monthly is a strict requirement. We’ll do it when it’s ready,\nTris: Hmm. I think that is fair. I should perhaps contrast with some existing schedules that I have in my life. So Lost Terminal, my science fiction. Podcast comes out every week, comes out on Monday, and because that is just me, it’s quite manageable. I’m not beholden to an editor, I’m not beholden to a collaborator, like there’s no adverts, it’s just me putting out 15 minutes of fiction every week.\nSo that’s how I can do it every week. The Phosphene catalog comes out every two weeks. Season 2 is hopefully going to be coming out on Halloween. And that is mostly pre recorded. I record with our mutual friend Wolfie, and, though that requires a bit more editing and perhaps a little more pickups and so forth, two weeks works very well there.\nModem Prometheus comes out every full moon, which is a nightmare because the moon drifts through the month and occasionally collides with other things like the weekly and fortnightly projects. And no boilerplate is, Monthly ish, since RSI, I’ve relaxed a little bit about it, but I certainly, I’m hoping to have one in August.\nRobin: It used, when it first started, it felt, it was probably more like fortnightly, wasn’t it?\nTris: As soon as that first video, that first Rust video blew up and ruined my email inbox with a thousand comments overnight, I was like, okay, what do I need, what can I do here? I need to make another video, and so I said, right, I’ll do it every two weeks.\nAnd then I have the classic YouTuber burnout. And now I do it about every month, but it’s movable feast, so it’s approximately every month, but I don’t hurt myself trying to publish on a certain day, not knowing in advance what could be happening that week.\nRobin: And have you got any impression that the different publishing schedules between those different productions makes any difference? Has any impact on? The audience.\nTris: They might not, you know. The audience, I think, were you to ask them. Your listeners, your viewers. They would always want more. That’s perfectly reasonable. I want, I would like to watch more of the things that I like as well. So they can’t be trusted to ask that question. And I don’t think, people didn’t unsubscribe when I went down from every two weeks to, every month.\nThings have been going from strength to strength. In fact, I think the quality of my output Has been getting higher and I now do longer videos like my ADHD video was 19 minutes long. It nearly killed me but I was able to do that. I couldn’t have done that in just a quick two week turnaround.\nRobin: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I think that a month is enough. I suppose the danger would be if it felt like it had dried up, right? If somebody thought, Oh, I don’t even know if this person’s like publishing anymore. That would then be bad. Then you’d probably lose subscribers.\nBut I think as long as you’re clearly still pushing content out.\nTris: Yes, uh, and typically a lot of podcatchers, which is what a podcast client is called, they tend to have like an automated little badge when you’re looking down, perhaps in search results or in the main page of a feed, they’ll say that the title, the author, a little description, you know, whatever, the logo, but also the podcatcher itself might how regular the podcast is.\nRobin: Okay, I don’t think we want to have a really strict schedule. We want to try and release it when it’s ready. But I think we do also want to try and make it regular ish. So we don’t want like the next gap to be more than like 50 to 150 percent of the previous gap.\nTris: Yes, I think we could aim for monthly, with a date that we commit to, at the very least in private, between\nourselves.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. Cool. Okay. That sounds good to me.\n[01:13:14] Conclusion\nTris: I’m having a really great time, as I always do, chatting with you, Robin. And thank you very much for your time here. This sort of discussion of tech and art and that sort of thing\nI wouldn’t usually talk about this sort of thing, day to day. Usually I would, stay in my house all day, every day, just writing, and producing and, being a digital hermit.\nSo it’s a great pleasure.\nRobin: I’m really enjoying it too. I’ve always wanted to, have more of these sorts of discussions. And, there’s very little opportunity in, normal life. So thank you so much for, suggesting the podcast. And I think it’s, I think it’s going well. I really enjoyed it.\nTris: Pleasure. Pleasure. I will talk to you next\nweek. We’ll do some more taping. And I suppose our listeners will hear from us. In a month.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/1/","title":"On Writing & Mental Health"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/2/":{"body":"\n\nWe discuss our experiences with conferences pre and post-pandemic, the psychological hurdles of public speaking, and our evolving use of Obsidian for personal knowledge management (PKM).\n\n📖 CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 Overcoming the Fear of Public Speaking\n11:40 I LIKE TRAINS\n13:15 Exploring the Rust Programming Language\n20:15 Obsidian Daily Note System and Priority Tasks\n32:45 Using Spaced Repetition for Capture\n46:15 Morning Routine and Habit Formation\n\n🔗 LINKS\nOurs\n\nhttps://robinwinslow.uk\nhttps://noboilerplate.org\nhttps://lostterminal.com\nhttps://modemprometheus.com\nhttps://phosphenecatalogue.com\n\nExternal\n\nA System For Writing - Bob Doto\nClojure: Turtles All The Way Down\nRust: Turtles All The Way Down\nFasterthanli.me\nObsidian.md\n\n🧑 CREDITS\nDecapsulate is a NAMTAO Production (namtao.com)\nIt is hosted by:\n\nTristram Oaten (https://mastodon.social/@0atman)\nRobin Winslow (https://union.place/@nottrobin)\n\nThis work is BrainMade (https://brainmade.org)\nTranscript\nDC2\n[00:00:00]\nTristram: A month ago I went to my first conference in five years. I think.\nRobin: Wow. Tell me about it.\nTristram: I used to go to conferences all the time before the pandemic. Before the pandemic started and I realized that I had lost the, lost the habit I’d, up until that point, I’d pushed myself very, very hard to, into public speaking positions.\nWhenever there was something at work that needed a presentation or if there was a, like a, a club at work where people would bring little presentations and talk about things that they liked, I would force myself to do them because at one point I was really, really scared and terrified of doing them\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: sort of exposure\nRobin: Uh, and\nTristram: and,\nRobin: is it?\nTristram: throughout my working life, I’ve tried to do these whenever there’s an in-person thing.\nand it started out small in just volunteering for like doing a presentation on the work we were doing something like that. But by the end of the 2010s, I was speaking at closure conferences, specifically closure X in London, the first time I just had a, lightning talk in my back pocket.\nAnd the next year I actually wrote a specific talk for. Closure X closure, by the way, perhaps some of our listeners might not know, um, is a lisp programming language. It’s the one with all the ens. Uh, it’s based on, based on Java. It’s the cool one if there is such a thing as a cool lisp.\nBut, uh,\nRobin: people say people that use it. Yes.\nTristram: yes. Right, exactly of the lisps, it’s of, it’s, it’s perhaps the coolest.\nthe first talk I did at closure X, I actually repurposed into one of my rust videos, one of my very early rust videos. Um, the first slide is, have I got a deal for you?\nAnd it was about how great closure is. Um, because Rust and Lisp were so similar in many regards, I was able to reuse much of that into a, a rust talk.\nRobin: you’re at risk of exposing your, your, your patterns. I mean, you’re like, you know, closure. Wonderful. The best thing in the world, everyone should use it. Rust. Wonderful. Best thing. What should you said?\nTristram: Right. I mean, I, if if tomorrow I find a new language that’s better than rust, I will start talking about that. There’s just been nothing, nothing left. Oh, I, I had to look it up ’cause I’ve, I, it’s seven years ago, um, turtles all the way down was my closure video. And then\nRobin: that.\nTristram: years ago, right. I rewrote it into rust turtles all the way, all the way down.\n’cause really I’m talking about like the, the macro system and how you can like build, build on the language without anyone’s asking permission. Without asking permission from anyone,\nRobin: saying is it’s really nice to have something that’s sort of written in its own language, I guess a whole system. language, basically it’s like, you know, you can, you can create the pieces, the fundamental bounding building blocks, and then you can build up on them and it’s all within the same, um, the same syntax.\nTristram: right? Yes, exactly. Like the, the way the way you write a python stack is you build very fast plumbing in sea and then you call those modules from Python. And that, that gets, that’s, that’s quite a good way of doing things really. It’s a good separation of concerns, but it comes with drawbacks. Um, I won’t, I won’t rehash the, the turtles, um, analogy.\nSo I, but I was doing all of this before 20, before 2020. And then either the pandemic or maybe just becoming somebody who does online things professionally, like I just fell out of the habit of. Going to conferences, like I’d worked so hard for 15 years to develop this. I suppose now that I’m saying this out loud, maybe my, maybe my itch had been scratched by doing the videos on YouTube, so I, it\nRobin: I, can I just, um, um, I\nTristram: it’s, please,\nRobin: like I think most all, I don’t know if I’ve ever been to a conference that I organize my, like as in that I, that I did independently from work. So for me, the reason why it dropped off if I were, you would absolutely be, because I no longer had an employer to like, to get, to get me to go to conferences.\nRight.\nTristram: Yeah. I mean, I, yeah, that is interesting. Like you’re no longer sort of in the, in the zone surrounded by people who are talking about the conferences that they’re going to.\nRobin: Well, and\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: you\nTristram: That,\nRobin: probably like a budget and a, you know, there’s, there’s some pressure and there’s, and there’s people from your company that won’t go to the same conference and that sort of thing, you know?\nTristram: Hmm. Yeah, that’s true. Yeah. I hadn’t thought of, and there’s, there’s probably a lot of small, you know, little, little reasons, but I, the big reason that I wanna bring up in quite a very personal way is that I think I was like becoming a shut away introvert more than I already am. This presumably didn’t happen to you as much because you were still working with other people, talking to other people even virtually. Um, whereas I’d cut all of that off and my days, which I’m very pleased with, it’s a great privilege, are spent quietly working on the things I want to do, not talking on Slack and in Zoom meetings, which was fricking dream.\nLovely.\nRobin: [00:05:00] I mean, I think you are actually kind of more comfortable with that. I feel like you are, you are, you are better at both ends than me in that you seem both. Even, even back then, I think you seemed certainly better than me at, um, deciding to create events. You were going to things like um, other,\nTristram: Hmm\nRobin: you know, and, and so you’d always have schedules.\nYou’d always have scheduled stuff, and had this ability to sit for a morning and, work on a thing. And I feel like I’ve become increasingly worth worse at both. And I think that it, the pandemic has played a huge role. Um, like\nTristram: hmm.\nRobin: I was working, but I was working remotely. And my work, which became a hundred percent remote after pandemic or during pandemic and then afterwards. And, um, and it, and it was very difficult to come out of. And, um, I, I’ve been to one conference since the Pandemic and that was, uh, um, lead, is it called Lead Dev? Um, yeah. Um,\nTristram: Well, oh yeah, I think I’ve heard of that one.\nRobin: Um, and, and it was great. It was, it was wonderful and it, but it was with my, it was with my new company. Um, I can’t go this year ’cause I’m, oh, I couldn’t go this year, I think.\n’cause it would, yeah, I think it, it clashed with a important thing. I dunno. but yeah, like I,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: I feel similar to you. Like I did have a rhythm of going to conferences and I haven’t stopped working. Like, to me, it doesn’t coincide with a massive change in my, in my working patterns, but, um, but I, but it does, it does more coincide with having my second child, so,\nTristram: That’ll do it.\nRobin: yeah. That’ll do it. Um, yeah. But, but I, I also definitely went through the same sort of pattern.\nTristram: So it was a huge surprise to me that this suddenly was on my radar. I, I wasn’t speaking or anything, I was just there as a, a, a participant, um, a, an audience member. Um, and I, and it was super last minute. I was doing some audio work for. Um, Amos from Faster Than Lime. Um, I don’t know if, if I have spoken to you particularly about, um, about this, but this is another, this is a fellow YouTuber.\nI feel like we’re all colleagues on YouTube because we, we don’t, we’re not competing with each other. If someone watches one of my videos, they’ll go over to a faster in line video afterwards if I’m, if I’m doing my algorithm right. Um, I compliment myself enormously by assuming that, um, and this is the, this is the, the person who my second rust video, I asked if I could borrow one of their blog posts to just kind of make into a video.\n’cause I had no idea what I was doing. Maybe my third video, maybe, maybe the second one, I, I was Okay. Uh, rust in 10 minutes is, is the, is based on Amos’s, um, Amos’s Post. Anyway, so we’ve all always been in the same circle and, um, we have become, uh, professional and, uh, personal associates. Um, that’s a weird way of saying friends.\nWe have become friends and, uh, I’ve, I’ve moved them from one, uh, category to another in my mental database. And, um, and as our listeners probably will now know that though, the project that I was recording is, uh, amos’s videos now contain, uh, a cutaways or added dialogue by a character called Cool Bear.\nAnd that’s me voiced by me. Amos has always had them in the blog posts. They’re these little inline cutaways that where the cool bear says, Hey, what’s with this code block? Why does it look like that? And, and that allows a very interesting narrative. Is it socra? Is it, is it a socra dialogue where you ask questions and then immediately answer them?\nRobin: I think is where you tell you make a point through the, through the mechanism of having a sort of master and a student. Um, conversation. I, I\nTristram: Right. Got it. Okay. Yes, exactly. Um, okay, good. So something like that except that it’s, it’s two masters perhaps talking to each other or they, they switch roles. And so it was really fun to record this, this character. ’cause it’s very definitely a character. Um, I, I tried to do a, uh, a certain voice. Um, leaning really into my, my British, uh, my British accent to, uh, to make it even funnier.\nUm, and, and it’s really, it’s been very, very good. Anyway, am and I were doing this recording, and at the end of it, as we were chatting, Amal said, are you going to Ure next week? Um, and I was like, no, I’d love to. Uh, why do you ask? And I didn’t even know there was a conference going on because I, they’d just fallen off my radar.\nI remember like in 2022 or 2021, I was thinking, oh, I should go to these rust conferences, you know, I’m a rust trooper. Um, and then I just forgot about that and just like, like, it just just left my brain. So I, get tickets with one week to go, six days to go, I think. And, suddenly I’ve got this ticket and I’m like, oh, no. so I check the hotels. They’re 300 euros a night.\nOh my God. I check the flights. They’re not, they’re not great. And I also don’t like flying, but I check the train. Train is affordable. Like it was, it was really [00:10:00] expensive because of how late everything was. But I don’t regret it for a second. whatever, no boilerplate budget I have should be spent on this sort of thing.\nThis is exactly the sort of thing that I. But do more like, it’s a like, spoiler. I had a great time. So I took the train. It’s always lovely leaving England by train I wonder if our, um, the people in our audience might, might not know this, but we have exactly one high speed rail system, one high speeded rail section in all of the uk and it’s from London to the ocean.\nIt gets you outta the uk. You can leave really quickly.\nRobin: Yeah, that’s the fastest bit because it has to interface with the European rail, which is better than the UK rail. And so we had to do a European grade that bit.\nTristram: Yes, exactly. If,\nRobin: which is quite funny. Um, but I wanted to just, just, um, step back, a half step.\nTristram: Hmm,\nRobin: Um,\nTristram: yes.\nRobin: you were saying you wanted to use, you know, if you had no boilerplate budget, this is what you’d use it for.\nPresumably you mean by that, that you think that? What you got out of this conference was, um, was like particularly good, like supportive of the No right project. Is that right?\nTristram: Absolutely. It was, it was wildly, wildly good. Like I, I, I suppose some people might, you know, maybe, maybe some, some companies or YouTubers or whatever might do advertising. Like there, there’s a lot of commercial stuff as there is with any, any conference. But I don’t think I, I want or need to do that. What I got out of it was inspiration.\nRobin: right.\nTristram: Like, it was so, so good to see all these incredible programmers, like absolute ninjas. Like there was a, a teenager hacking on the Linux kernel and like telling us all about it. Like this is, this is so inspiring to see all these, all these cool people in our, uh, rust community. Uh, it was so inspiring that on the train home, the train is four hours from London to Amsterdam.\nUh, on the train home. I just wrote another video and then published it a week later. Like, I’d on, on the way there, I just published my writing is thinking video or writing at the speed of thought. I think that is the title. And I wanted to get that published just, just before the, the conference, just to make sure that people remembered who I was.\nUh, it’d been, it’d been over a month since I’d, since I’d done everything. I’m slowing down my, my schedule as the videos get like more complex, which is good and bad. I’d like, I’d like to do like small videos and long videos just to keep things fresh.\nRobin: just\nTristram: And that took me.\nRobin: every other day. And then I said in the background, you’re, you’re doing your like\nTristram: Oh God. Well, that’s what I’m doing. I, I’ve, I’m finding that I’ve got these smaller videos in that I’m just, I’m pushing out. But in the background, there’s the big projects. Like at the moment I’ve got a video that the draft title is a system for thinking, a system for thinking. I think, I think that is what I’m gonna go for.\nUm, and it’s a big, big topic. Perhaps we will speak about it, uh, later on, like a obsidian task management, PKM EGAs and loads of stuff. And it’s a big topic. The video that I’m pushing out, hopefully next week or the week after, is on async programming in Rust. A much more straightforward topic, at least in terms of, uh, deep creativity required.\nIt’s more of a, it’s more of an explainer. It’s more of an opinion video. And it’s nice. It’s a nice, tight, tight turnaround. The video I made, the video I wrote on the train back to London was, um, my last video, which is just oxidize your CLI number two, like it’s a, a carry on video from a a, it’s a carryover video that’s not what we call it, a sequel, that’s what we call them.\nIt’s a sequel to a video I made a couple of years ago with like, Hey, what tools can you replace with rust? And it’s way, way more impressive now. Like you can replace the entire user land of, uh, of your Linux machine. Like, like the head. Program like tail, uh, gr like all of these gu new tools are just, have been rewritten in Rust And Ubuntu is, has got an optional like switch for the, did you see this, the canonical pushed out a, a very simple one line, uh, one-line change where you can swap out your user land tools with the rust version.\nDid you see that?\nRobin: I ha I basically haven’t used Ubuntu, um, I, since that Canonical, maybe not quite, maybe, maybe since I started my new job. But I, I know, I mean, I’m so far from, from knowing that level of detail on what’s going on in, in Ubuntu\nTristram: Ah, it was, that was, there was some hand wring involved, you know, because you’ve got the canoe tools. They’re like, you know, decades and decades of, of, of slow iteration. They’re extremely stable. There’s 600 or so unit tests for the whole suite. And then you’ve got this upstart rust project that in the space of a year or two has, is, is now, I think 550 of those 600 acceptance tests for the canoe tools are passing in the rust version.\nAnd there’s still plenty of work to be done. Um, but I just switched my whole user land to them on my Nix OS system and I’ve just not noticed any difference. Like, everything’s working fine. Like all of [00:15:00] the, uh, maybe I, I think that they, they were very optimized before. Um, like rust is fast, but it’s like, it, it’s, it’s as fast as see.\nRobin: I mean, um, you know, like I use RIP Grab, right? RIP GRP is way faster than gr obviously it’s got a slightly\nTristram: Yes,\nRobin: Maybe I’m missing some key difference in the actual feature set, but. But like, are there not similar speed improvements that can be made simply, not necessarily because it’s written in rust, but simply by starting from the ground up with your, with, with how you’re actually solving the problem, maybe?\nTristram: I, I bet there are, and the biggest one is rusts, fearless concurrency. Like it’s, you have to be extremely cautious and careful, and you have to know what you’re doing to write concurrent and parallel programs in C and it requires a lot of thorough testing and it, it’s extremely, uh, it’s extremely challenging.\nWhereas in rust, it’s trivial. So a big speed increase is that there would’ve been, I, I, I’m guessing, but I, I think I, I have a good idea. You can, you can get loads of low hanging fruit that the seed developers just didn’t wanna touch. Like, you could make these five threads, you could make this, this little inner loop here.\nYou could paralyze it if only you wanted to. And in certain circumstances, you don’t want to, uh, you don’t, it’s not that you can’t do it in c it’s that the initial reaction is, oh, I be, I better not, or maybe I’ll do that later. You know, like, that’s some future, you know.\nRobin: like makes absolutely, makes, makes that difference in a huge, but, but, but you, it sounds like\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: saying that that efficiency, that speed of be, of doing these difficult things, like in c they can be done and they are done and they lead to very efficient programs, but it takes a long time because you are carefully considering it, designing it, then you’re testing it really thoroughly, et cetera in rust\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: they’ve got some core mechanisms that mean that the testing, like it’s not so brittle.\nIt’s not so dangerous. Um,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: but, but, but that’s, but that’s not so much led to a suite of much more performant tools. Instead it’s, it’s led to very, very quick meeting of the same standard, if you know what I mean. That’s what it sounds like.\nTristram: Yes, exactly. Yes. Right, exactly. There’s, and there’s, it’s exactly the same happened with the, with the, uh, Linux on Arm project, or rather the Linux on Mac project. Um, like Sahi, Lena wrote the GPU driver for the MacBook in like 10 weeks because she wrote it in, in rust. Like, you get a huge speed up because you’re not firefighting all of the time.\nYou know, it’s quite straightforward what I, what I say in my videos. I think bears repeating these things are possible in other languages, but in rust they very easy like that. That is a very, very big level up. Like it, it.\nRobin: the, the mind fuck of rust.\nTristram: Yes, the, uh, the, the, the, the bo checker, there’s one, there’s one, one thing to understand. Yeah, exactly. And I, and I suppose that the type system, but like, if you can understand Garvin’s type system, you can understand rust. It’s, it’s just a bit more complicated,\nRobin: the borrow\nTristram: so.\nRobin: referring to. Yeah. I haven’t, I\nTristram: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. That, that’s, that’s ’cause you’ve, you’ve not, you’ve not watched my video on the borrowed checker.\nLike, it’s so trivial. It’s just, it’s it’s in no other,\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: it’s in, it’s in no other language. That’s the thing. The, the, the, the bo checker says that you, you can have a, you have as many read-only references to a variable as you like.\nRobin: on your story.\nTristram: Oh, right. All right, all right.\nRobin: a,\nTristram: Right.\nRobin: a, a episode about you teaching me rust, we can, but let’s, let’s do it. That’s a, that’s a\nTristram: I’m making a note. Future episode, teach Robin Rust live on, on air. Okay. So the, the second problem with rewriting everything, the goo tools in rust, I think probably is this, uh, is this suite of, of acceptance tests, the unit tests, the canoe acceptance tests. Probably you can break acceptance tests with parallelism or with concurrency.\nLike the tests might, might not be written, assuming that it’s going to be parallel or parallelizable. Uh, so I bet, I bet there are some places where they can’t do it because the goal is 100% future parity and then perhaps improvement.\nRobin: Mm. Yep, yep. No, that makes sense.\nTristram: So,\nRobin: Um,\nTristram: I dunno why, why I talked about this.\nRobin: you were talking about the Rust Conference. Um, I’m not quite sure what got us onto that detail of rust.\nTristram: It’s ’cause I, on, on the way back, on the train back, I was so inspired by the conference that I, I just like the, the, the words flowed outta my fingers onto the keyboard. And I just wrote for four hours continuously and had another video ready to go by the time I got home. It was just, it was wonderful. So an inspiration, I think.\nRobin: that experience, I would suggest the train ride as is important of a, of an element of it as the conferences, because I completely agree with you.\nTristram: Ah,\nRobin: every conference, my brain is exploding, but I don’t normally have a four hour train, train, ride to then, you know, do nothing but write\nTristram: right,\nRobin: Um, which would probably be quite, you know, it’s quite a good mechanism.\nTristram: it sure is my plan for this coming weekend. Uh, I’m going back down to, uh, see my parents, which is another four hour train ride. Um, and uh, so I, my plan is like [00:20:00] I’ll finish the current video that I’m working on the script in that train ride. Uh, I agree love, love a train ride, bad wifi or bad 4G plus.\nNothing really to do that’s good for productivity.\nRobin: mean that\nTristram: So,\nRobin: awesome. Like I’m quite jealous.\nTristram: So I mentioned very briefly when we were talking about the conference that I have a lot to say about obsidian. PKM Zettelkasten, so forth.\nRobin: You said you’ve got an upcoming video.\nTristram: Uh, yeah, I do. Yes. The, uh, system for thinking, uh, it’s related to my previous video, you know, how, how to write at the speed of thought, like it, it’s all going around in my brain and like there’s this big idea that I, that I’m working on and small videos, small ideas are kind of falling out of it almost as a side effect, but it’s not the main, the main idea.\nThe main idea is this system for System for Thinking video. Uh, the title I’m sure you’ll recognize is, um, base. The title is Inspired by a System for writing a book by Bob Dotto. I’ll make sure that the, the link is in the show notes, um, which is a recent discovery of mine and I think is the best book on the Zettelkasten method.\nI think I recommended it to you.\nRobin: I think I’ve, um, if it’s the one you recommended, which I admit I don’t remember the title of, then I, you know, I mean, I read probably a third or a bit more. Um,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: think I was, you know, it’s like I had a plane ride, right? Um, a plane ride. Do you call it a\nTristram: Uh\nRobin: Do you ride a plane or\nTristram: oh Yeah. You don’t, I don’t, you don’t ride a plane, do you? A flight.\nRobin: I had a\nTristram: You had a flight. Oh,\nRobin: It’s,\nTristram: fun,\nRobin: shorter\nTristram: fun.\nRobin: it, isn’t it? I had a flight and, um, I spent most of the flight reading the book, and then I think I might have had even like a train ride afterwards or something. And I was reading the book then and I was taking notes and all this sort of thing. Um, but it certainly hasn’t flowed into, I mean, I suppose, I suppose my impression of it from the book, which I didn’t finish, um, only got as far as it helped me like it, like ever so slightly augmented my use of obsidian, like for general note keeping, but I, but I certainly am not following like a, um, unification, general unification system of, of like thought, um. In my, in my obsidian use so far.\nTristram: A Grand unified theory.\nRobin: exactly\nTristram: Tell me about your, uh, of city news.\nRobin: right. Yeah. Well, um, so it’s, it’s always been a bit, I don’t think I’m a person who can, like I’ve seen how you use obsidian and I feel like you, like yours is like a world building experience. Like you, you’ve got different colors for different parts of the day. You’ve given, you’ve, you’ve named like areas, um, rooms, um, within your schedule, like, you know, the library where you’re gonna do your reading and, and this kind of thing.\nSo, so it’s like, so when\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: it, it’s like you’re inhabiting a world that you’ve built and that I think makes it so much more, um, tangible for you. And it also means that you, that that, because it’s a whole project that you know, and, and, and a significant and and impressive looking project, um, it makes it easier for you to then like to really care about refining it, I think, and making sure that it’s, um, tidy right now. I doubt I am able to do that. I think I tend to have too many parallel things that I care about in my mind at any given time. And my use of obsidian is like, I’ll only use it and this is also kinda the way I work, but I’ll only use it, um, where I think I can do something quick that doesn’t have to be perfect and it nonetheless adds something. So I use the Daily Notes\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: for a while. I tried using weekly notes and I rejected that. So I use the Daily Notes system and I’ve got it so that I’ve set up a little template so that every time I create a new note, it links back to Daily Notes System. It’s got a little set of, you know, standard front matter. I’ve got some categories in there. Um, but it’s like the whole thing is set up with the understanding that the, all, every one of the systems I’m using are gonna have massive number of loose ends, right? Fundamentally, it’s a place for\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: throw information in such a way that if I came back and wanted to find it again, hopefully I could, right? Um, more or less that. So then I, I, I write down tasks I want to complete in future. In there I start new project documents, which I may or may not return to. And I use the system in my daily note, um, of like having, I link through to what I think I call, um, like, I dunno, important documents or something, or, I can’t remember what the word I use is. Um, but\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: a lot of, so, so, so a lot of it is like, I’ve only got a collection of about six documents that I consider to be high enough importance that they’re there in my face for every daily note. And that includes my priority tasks document, which I will throw stuff into when I think it’s an important task.\nBut I’ve never, ever managed to have the habit. Of, of like being like, oh, okay, I’ve got some space now I’m gonna go and look at my task list. I’m gonna start at the top. Like that never happens. Sometimes I’ve accidentally done one of them because they came back around in my mind and, and I cared about them, but I never, never ever followed the tasks from the [00:25:00] top. Um, so yeah, so, so my use of, and I keep a journal in there and stuff, and it’s all linked up, but, but my use of obsidian is like that. Like it’s, it’s lots of different patchworky things that I cobble all together and it, and it helps me that they’re all in one place. Um, but any, um, any, any serious structure or any serious routine, um, that’s well kept to, is an emergent property of me using obsidian rather than designed, if that makes sense.\nTristram: It does, it does. And I, I struggle with this as well. Um, I, I think the, I, I recognize everything that you are talking about, and this is where I was five years ago when I started using obsidian. Um, it, it, it, it was, it, these things don’t like it. It doesn’t just come naturally. It certainly didn’t with me.\nAnd it sounds like it’s not, not with you either. And I think that’s okay. And I think that’s like, I wanna reassure you, and maybe, maybe I reassure, reassure our listeners that this, this is, this is not something that comes so quickly and like my extremely complex use of obsidian running 80 plugins is not something that I, that happened at the start.\nIn fact, in the first year I stopped and started using obsidian all the time. Like I bounced off it. Like I, it didn’t, I thought it didn’t fit my brain and I went back to, to doist or org mode or, or whatever I was using at the time. And, but I kept coming back to it because there’s something, there’s something there.\nThere’s something in the app\nRobin: I,\nTristram: and in\nRobin: I\nTristram: Yeah,\nRobin: I’m a step beyond that, right? Because. Obsidian is\nTristram: of course.\nRobin: default place to keep information. I have it on my phone, I have it on my computer. I know how to put stuff in there, and I would have confidence that I know where it is, right? Like it’s not like I’m still in the phase of like, I’m half using obsidian, but I’m still not sure whether it, whether it’s whether it’s for me.\nAnd so I’m half using this other\nTristram: Great.\nRobin: I am using obsidian\nTristram: Hmm, hmm.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: Great. Uh, Avi then, so you’re, you’re sort of a year or two into, into it. Just as I was a year or two into it. And I still to this day have this problem of like the divine self and the mundane self, like constantly fighting like I imagine tomorrow that I’m gonna be super organized, that I’m definitely gonna follow this whole checklist that I’ve made and then tomorrow comes and the plan goes out the window.\nBut I feel like the exercise of doing it and, and trying to make the plan and trying to follow the plan every month or year even, it’s a very slow thing. The, the ship slowly moves a degree to the right. You know, I’m, I’m, I’m getting better slowly.\nRobin: Well that’s my experience as well. Yeah.\nTristram: I, and I, I’ve, I, there’s a, there’s a metaphor that I thought of recently ’cause I’m writing the system for thinking video and I, I hope it is useful. The, the, the best, uh, the best. I, hmm. What am I trying to say here? The metaphor is that you are, you are trying to throw a ball forward in time to yourself tomorrow and.\nYou want your future self to catch the pool and carry on doing the thing that you’re hoping, or maybe it’s like a relay, you’re passing the relay bat on through time and you are, you’re hoping that the, your yourself tomorrow will pick it up and carry on running, you know, carry on\nRobin: metaphor\nTristram: race.\nRobin: it’s, I think it’s really good because, because the relay, I feel like it’s\nTristram: Yeah,\nRobin: inevitable in the metaphor that it’s gonna happen. it might happen, it’s not,\nTristram: yeah.\nRobin: as it should because then you, then you’ll lose to your, to your opponents.\nBut, but it’ll happen. Like it’s not her passing a bat on, it’s not difficult. Whereas catching a ball\nTristram: Right.\nRobin: potentially difficult.\nTristram: Okay, good. That, that, the catch ball metaphor is the one that I’ve got, and I second guessed it when explaining it to you because you can drop the ball, you know, like you, you so forth. So there are two, there are two parts of this, this equation. And they, you, you’ve gotta have a lot of trust in both.\nSo the first one is that you’ve got to be able to capture things you want to do in the future, but you can’t do them yet. And that’s the capture side. Like in GTD it’s called the inbox in settle gas and it’s called fleeting notes and all kinds of stuff. Very similar stuff. It’s just like, write down the thing you want and trust that you are going to put it somewhere where your future self will at least look at it.\nThey will at least see it. That, that, no, you make this half of the equation makes no assumption that they will do anything with that, but at least your future self will see it. It’s on the calendar, it’s in the task list, it’s an email notification.\nRobin: about, I schedule as calorie events now, like I was explaining,\nTristram: Right. Okay. Yeah, exactly. Because you, you don’t trust that this system will put it in front of the eyes of your future self, and that does slowly improve over time. The second half of the system is tomorrow’s self. Your, your future mundane, profane, whatever it’s called, the the problem self. That guy in the future who’s not gonna do what you want.\nRobin: The bastard.\nTristram: Um, we all have Yeah, I know. Always ruining like, he’s spending all of my money. Wait, no. Am I spending his money? I forget how it goes. So the, it’s important, it’s important that, so they’ve, they’ve, they’ve gotta catch the ball and then carry on doing, doing the [00:30:00] thing that you want. So you need to have a system that not just stores the notes in carefully that you are sure, yes, this is categorized, right?\nOr I’ve, I’ve, I’ve captured this. Wonderful. Then you have to be able to pass it over to your future self and it has to be surfaced. For me, this is quite a recent thing. I’ve got a combination of two techniques that seem to be working very well, and these are, this is definitely gonna be something that’s part of the video.\nI take fleeting notes, which are just new notes in obsidian with a, a reasonable title. Like, you know, buy the milk, go out and get this call, Robin, what have you. Anything like that. Anything that comes to mind. And I put that into the system with a tag fleeting. And then I. My job is done, the inbox has been satisfied and I’m confident that it’s out of my brain and I can trust the system to work because it does.\nThe next day, every day when I sit down to do my morning writing, I start with one hour of admin. I can’t just start writing Lost terminal or no boilerplate straight away. Like I have to sort of get into it. And a way that I have found, I used to get into things by just like browsing the internet. Like we all like, like, like we all used to, you know, maybe I check my feet or check imager or check my email, whatever.\nAnd that is very dangerous because it can take you down a rabbit hole. And then half the time I wasn’t writing when I should be\nRobin: more than, much\nTristram: an hour or two had passed. Right? Yes, exactly. And, but what I found is that admin, specifically obsidian admin and making sure my inbox, my obsidian inbox of fleeting notes is like processed and I can optimize the process a little bit to do some tweaks, you know, like stuff like that to make it enjoyable.\nAllowing myself to do that has been really good because I guarantee I’ve guaranteed to myself that tomorrow, the tomorrow tri is going to read every single fleeting note I write today. And not just that, but the way that I read these fleeting notes, I’m very proud of. I used, I use s uh. To solve the problem, uh, that Bob talks about in, uh, a system for writing the Ze Carsten book that I, I recommended.\nAnd you have, you have read, in fact, if you’ve read the first third, you have read this, he describes some fleeting notes. Can’t be actioned. And so they must be, they must have a different category for like snoozing them. He calls them sleeping, sleeping fleeting nights. And every now and then you go through that list and go, oh, can I, can I do any of these?\nAre any of these relevant yet sleeping? And I started off just doing that, tagging them, fleeting sleeping. But then it begs the question, well, how do you know when to come back to them? And this system, it already exists and is called spaced repetition. It’s usually used as I’m sure you and our listeners know for language learning or knowledge learning.\nThese are flashcards, anky, uh, Duolingo, the, these, these are all space repetition systems, but I use it for fleeting notes. So when I drop a fleeting note into my system over the course of the day, the next day I cram, uh, in the express, in the, the terminology of, of space repetition. I cram all of my fleeting notes.\nAnd so I see every single one of my new ones, and then I decide on each of them, if I’m going to just do them. Or like get ’em out the way or send that email or whatever, or put them into a, to do or schedule them on the calendar for today. Like, something, something has to happen. And if I don’t do that, or I don’t want to do it today, ’cause it’s not super urgent, I just say I, I just, I just tell the, the space repetition system that, uh, I’ve, I’ve studied this and this was hard.\nRemind me of this again tomorrow.\nRobin: Oh, okay.\nTristram: Uh, which is what, uh,\nRobin: you are\nTristram: we,\nRobin: a difficulty metric out of how it’s like, it’s like things that are written but is hard necessarily. Right? So the thing, the thoughts that I’m having while you are saying this, is that one of\nTristram: yeah.\nRobin: problems I think with, um, my task, you know, my, my task setting for myself in general\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: that I think of so many things like, like so many more things I could be doing that I never have time to do.\nSo it’s a, it is a version of\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: you know, when you’re working in a, in a software team. The backlog is infinite, right? The backlog is always gonna be longer than whatever you might have time for. So you need to have good prioritization because you\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: sure you’re doing the things at the top. And\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: what I really like about, I really like what you are saying in the sense that like, um, you are, you are, you’re sort of skimming, skimming this long list so that you are refreshing your mind. So you’re keeping it like available to you. And then, and then you have the complete freedom to like, to like, choose the things that jump out within it to say like, oh, that’s actually something I’m gonna do.\nNow that’s actually important, but you, but, but you don’t need to worry about the fact that you will be reminded so that if it was something super important, you haven’t just like put it on a list, forgotten about it, and now you’re never gonna look at it again. And then three months later you’re like, oh my God, shit, I really needed to do that.\nAnd I just never, never came back in. You know, I never looked at my list. Right. [00:35:00] So you are saying at least it’s gonna come back in\nTristram: Yeah,\nRobin: and then you can choose, you can choose to highlight it. but presumably some of the things like firstly. has a scaling problem. Because if we assume that you are making more notes than you would you could ever do, this list is gonna get longer and longer and longer until presumably it’s not even skimmable. Right.\nTristram: sure does.\nRobin: and then And then the other thing is, is if you just said every time you said, oh actually I’m not gonna do that now, it increased its difficulty. It’s not necessarily because it’s not difficult. Right. Some of them or, or because it’s difficult. Some of them it might be because actually they don’t matter anymore.\nOr, or it’s like, you know, I over like I’m never gonna, in fact, I would say most of the things, like if you think about it in terms of like how you might work in a software team or how my, my software team works. Um, lots of things come in, we choose certain ones that are to prioritize anything we haven’t prioritized, probably we really should just close or delete or whatever because it’s not gonna happen.\n’cause no one cares. Right. Like, so that’s, so there’s a lot in\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: I would imagine.\nTristram: So this problem of scaling. Is the problem that all inbox systems have. Like once you’ve got more than a screen full of text, of emails of to-dos you, it, it, it ceases to become a useful skimmable inbox and it just becomes kind of too much to handle and you declare bankruptcy and switch system back to something else, and then that system fills up.\nAnd then there’s too many events on your calendar, too many tasks on your software, whatever system you chose. The, the reason that I think misusing spaced repetition for this purpose works geniusly is because it’s extremely granular. Snoozing something until tomorrow is a pretty good way of, uh, of managing your current day.\nUh, list snoozing things to next week. Yeah, that works too. Like you can decide, well, how urgent is this thing I’ll snooze in? This is an algorithmically perfect way of doing that. When you use space repetition, you get one card, like it show, it shows you one card at a time. If you’re using Duolingo, it’d be one word at a time or a phrase or whatever, but here it’s a fleeting note of a time fleeting note at a time.\nAnd I look at that fleeting note and I, and I critically think to myself, what is this really, really urgent? Or is. Is this something I can put off and a little bit or put off a lot? And in the obsidian space, repetition plugin, which I use and recommend you, you’ve got, you get three buttons, easy, medium, hard, or it’s actually easy, good and hard, good.\nBit of a weird, what would word for whatever. And all those do is they say, oh, don’t, don’t increment the reminder day to a bit more in the future or increment it to be a little less in the future or make it really, really urgent. And I actually wanna see it again tomorrow. Um, this, this is obviously the space, uh, the space repetition algorithm where hard things you revise more often.\nEasy things get pushed and pushed, um, exponentially into the future because you actually, you’ve already remembered you’re, you’re okay. Uh, I think that is the same algorithm that I want for my fleeting notes because if I want, if I look at a fleeting note and it’s not something that I really care about, it doesn’t seem very urgent, I’ll just rate it as easy and then I won’t even see it tomorrow.\nI’ll probably see it the next day or the day after that. If, when I’m shown that again in a few days time, I also think, wow, this is not important. This is not important still, then it pushes it even further into the future and it might take a week. So it’s like, it’s a non date, date-based snoozing system that I don’t have to think when am I snoozing it to?\nWhen am I, what am I doing? What am I, whatever. It’s just solved it. I think I could now have. 10,000 fleeting notes at various states of snoozing that the system is just keeping track of.\nRobin: I like that. Um, but I, I suppose by thinking that it’s very, very scalable and it can hold a lot, I would suggest there, there probably is still a limit to how much it can hold you, you like, how would it scale? One way it could scale is that it, um, it, it starts to delay tasks longer and longer so that you don’t get the, you know, you, you could imagine it scaling in that way, right?\nBecause if like a thousand became 10,000, it’s just that you, that, that,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: see each of them less frequently, but that’s not necessarily acceptable. Right. So, so it still has a scaling problem, I would say. And so the piece that I’d want to make sure was built into it somehow was this idea of deleting, closing, you know, getting rid of things that actually don’t matter anymore, but maybe you think that just happens automatically.\nLike obviously if something really doesn’t matter, we’re gonna get rid of it anyway. So it doesn’t really need to, it doesn’t need an extra solution because I do already do it,\nTristram: Yes. Yeah. That, that, that’s, that is, that is the workflow. Like one, after I’ve done something, let’s say the fleeting note is, is like a, an interesting turn of phrase that I think might work really well in one of my podcasts that I’m writing. I will just copy it, put it into the, the podcast note and delete the fleeting note.\nThen I’ll never see it ever again.\nRobin: no, of course. You would delete fleeting notes. I just meant, um, it’s the action of like having a brain fart one day and being like, well, what about this? Throw it into the system tomorrow [00:40:00] or next week. It comes back up and I’m like, actually, you know what, I’m realistically never gonna do that. Get rid of it.\nAnd it’s that, it’s that, that I’d like to reinforce. ’cause I think there is a lot of value in, uh, it’s, it’s like, yeah, it’s, it’s a yny philosophy. That’s not exactly what Yny means because Yny is about building software. But it, but to me it’s important for the same\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: right? Like you could build an infinitely complex software system.\nYou don’t do that because that’s terrible engineering and it’ll probably never be released. So you design it or you don’t undersign it, but you design it right down to the basics in an.\nTristram: Okay. Well, I mean the\nRobin: System. I, I’m loving the sound of, I particularly love the sound of, um, uh, yeah, like being able to snooze without thinking when like it’s really annoying to have to like decide when.\nTristram: yes, it, the problem, the, one of the problems that Zettelkasten solves is. Uh, in a separate, a separate, a separate problem that Zeen solves is when you’re taking a note, you shouldn’t have to think hard about where it goes when you’re just writing something down on the back of an envelope or you’re just quickly putting something in.\nAny friction is bad friction. Like you’re just gonna get that out of your brain on there and then forget about it because you trust the system to bring it back at the correct point, which for me are these morning, these morning reviews. And that’s, that’s what this does. Um, ze is a bottom up, bottom.\nExcuse me. Zein is a bottom up system where instead of saying, okay, like in Dewey Decimal, this goes in science, natural science, chemistry, organic chemistry, we, these are already way too many decisions. Like imagine if you had to do that every time. Nightmare. Whereas in Ce Castine, because it’s bottom up, you clip it straight to, let’s say benzene, and you put the note right under there, you don’t have to go all the way down through whatever hierarchy you’ve got.\nYou just go straight to the, to the edge. Uh, and I think this achieves the same sort of goal because you’re not thinking, well, when am I snoozing this to? And that question is actually very complex and requires knowledge of your calendar or at least thinking of your calendar. No good at all. So,\nRobin: I mean, so, so you see what I find interesting here is that you are talking about Ze Carsten, is a system for ideas and,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: and talking about task management, and we seem to sort of naturally fallen into an idea that they’re the same thing, which I had not considered before.\nThat they could be the same thing really.\nTristram: They, they, they, they aren’t, but they’re very related. They’re related. The reason I’m conflating them is because we’re talking about the input, the inbox, the fleeting notes, and, and that is, that is unified in my system. And in fact, I would recommend that anyone who is building a second brain or a PKM system for themselves only have one inbox.\nDoesn’t matter whether those are fleeting thoughts or tasks to do, your inbox must be just one place because two places is one too many already. This is a very old idea from, from David Allen’s GTD book. The, uh, the, the grandfather of this inbox idea is that if you have two inboxes, let’s say your email, ancient ancient history.\nAncient history, the like before YouTube, therefore it’s very old. The, if you have two inboxes, your eyes can only look at one at once, which means you cannot fundamentally trust what your eyes are telling you. If your eyes are saying, oh, my inbox empty, but I’ve got this other inbox here, lemme just check that, oh, that’s empty too, but maybe I’ve got a new thing in the first inbox, you it, you’ve got this subtle like subconscious unease that actually maybe you’re supposed to be doing something.\nSo one inbox genius idea. That’s why I’m unifying these two.\nRobin: Yes, except it, that almost makes it more interesting. Are you saying that notes Zettelkasten are tasks or not? Because if you\nTristram: No, no. Fleet. Fleet?\nRobin: you have a Zettelkasten inbox and you have a no.\nTristram: No, no. Just, just fleeting notes are just strings. Strings of text. Those strings of text have to be interpreted by, uh, by Tris tomorrow, and then he will decide whether or not to make a task in my task management system or to write up something else or, or what have you. It’s,\nRobin: so they are the same\nTristram: it’s not up to me.\nRobin: thing.\nTristram: Yes. The inbox is unified.\nRobin: one inbox, which has a list of notes, and a note\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: a task or it may be a thought, a idea.\nTristram: The reason I’m pushing back against this is I, I deliberately don’t decide at this point whether or not it is a tasker of thought\nRobin: but so it’s, so, it’s so, it’s quite, so I suppose, I think you are saying that they are the same thing in every, like as far, just about as far as I could possibly imagine they might be, if you see what I mean. Um, which I like. I mean, it’s a nice, uh, it’s a nice idea. Um, the, the, the bit where I’m gonna\nTristram: tasks start off as ideas, right.\nRobin: the bit where I’m gonna fall down is that you say the place\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: are gonna, where you bring these things back up to your future self is in their morning routine of, of, um, going through the inbox.\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: Um, but that [00:45:00] doesn’t mean, you know, I mean, I do have an inbox. I do go through it every now and then, so I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna\nTristram: I don’t think you should go through the inbox. I think you should set up this, the space repetition system to go through this inbox for you.\nRobin: system for you, the point where you read the things that have been brought back up by our space repetition, uh, repetition system is\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: down and looking through the list of things that your space recognition, uh, repetition system is bringing up.\nTristram: Right. That doesn’t happen for you.\nRobin: Uh, I have. Yes. I don’t think I’ve ever had a routine like, you know, just about managed to brush my teeth daily. Um,\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: but my wake up and sleep times don’t tend to be regular. And I, yes. So I don’t think I can ever say that I’ve had like a string of as much as like a week or two weeks where I have at roughly the same time every day sat down and done roughly the same task, per se, apart from standup at work, which you don’t really have, have any choice. Um,\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: yeah, so I mean, I, I, I don’t think, obviously, you know, you can’t solve all the problems with, of my life with one system. Um, and as I say, I\nTristram: I mean,\nRobin: I\nTristram: maybe.\nRobin: and I do still manage to live as a, as an adult. Um, just about, so I. this wouldn’t be worse. Right. Um, but\nTristram: No, indeed. No indeed. I, I\nRobin: than I am,\nTristram: only, only recently, Robin, only recently, like in 2020 before Lost Terminal, I had no morning routine. Like as you say, I like, I, I, I like cleaned my teeth and I probably had breakfast at some point because my body was hungry. But like the start of this was my, my first habit, which was I’ve got to write lost terminal before work.\nIf I don’t write it before work, I’ll work. I’ll be too tired after work. So it must happen before work, therefore it must, must, must happen. It’s like you taking the, your, your kids to to school. Like it can’t not happen. It’s the, it absolutely must happen. And I, my baby lost terminal had had the same scheduling problem that it, these things had to happen every day.\nSo I was actually forced into that. And then after a few, after like a year, I had this morning routine of like sitting down and writing and then I could like hang things off it. You know, you just need that one thing, you know, that first little habit.\nRobin: the, but the interesting thing there is you described Lost Terminal as your baby, uh, with, with an implication that that’s part of how you managed to do it, which is, which is very insightful. I mean, you know, you’re absolutely right that the most routine things that I do successfully are my children’s routine because they need\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: and I know that and I care about them. And it’s that caring that I’m really sort of curious about because I also feel like, you know, my life has, is, is, is improving significantly recently. Um, and it\nTristram: Great.\nRobin: in taking charge of it. Which is a version of caring. It’s like caring about myself. It’s like I’m taking the time to think what is it that I really care about?\nAnd, and so that makes a\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: difference. So, so, so really it just needs the, something to trigger me into believing this routine supports my core values. Right? Like, like that’s\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: and then I would do it. Right. So, so it’s not, probably not as far as, as we’re saying. So anyway, I really like the system.\nUm, I, I am curious, I don’t think you should maybe go into it further now ’cause we, this will get long, but I’m, I’m\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: how you configure your, um, scheduled something, whatever you call it, that system\nTristram: Yes, the, the space repetition system. Well, you and I can talk offline about it, and the listener will eventually be able to watch my video on it.\nRobin: that’s pretty cool. Oh, yes. Well, so will I, so maybe, maybe I can just, if, if we don’t manage to follow up on it, I can just watch a video and then I’ll know.\nTristram: It’s perfect.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/2/","title":"Agoraphobia and Thinking in Systems"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/3/":{"body":"\n\nWe get excited about the stats on episode 1 and talk a little about podcast logistics.

I’ve crunched the stats and between YouTube and the podcast feed, there have been so far 4,000 plays of episode one, which is insane.\nRobin: Is amazing.\nTristram: we a week into it? That’s wonderful.\nRobin: but do we\nTristram: I.\nRobin: Is that does that include crawlers and things or do we know their real\nTristram: Hmm.\nI think we’re okay with this data because it falls off organically, like huge numbers of people listened on day one, two, and then it has fallen off more organically. Whereas a crawler, I would expect periodic or something more like that.\nAnd certainly not MP three, like crawling, an MP three is a bit weird, But anyway, the point is that these 4,000 people are incredible. Presume the listener is one of those peopleThat is, astonishing and I’m very grateful as I’m sure you are.\nRobin: you. Yes.\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: I never\nTristram: So\nRobin: to be as popular as it’s been already.\nTristram: yes.\nRobin: We haven’t really figured out the format of the show yet.\nTristram: Yeah I think it’s quite nice to figure it out, almost with the listener, although in a very, one way relationship there, but we’ll figure it out as we go. I’ve got a bit of housekeeping here, so thanks everyone who commented and has been chatting on the Discord, this is all fantastic.\nThe feedback’s been wonderful. And we are especially grateful to those who’ve signed up to the Patreon patreon.com/deencapsulate or it’s all on the website. The patrons get at the moment, early episodes,\nRobin: website,\nTristram: so when it,\nRobin: is deencapsulate.com,\nTristram: yes you’re a natural robin, you’re a natural. You’ve just gotta say it all the time, repetitive, but we, if we don’t do it, who else will?\nRobin: Early episode. So when, for example, when this episode drops in the public feed, patrons will have access to episode four already. Yeah\nTristram: We’ve also got a merch store. You go to encapsulate and click on store. There is exactly one item. Available for purchasing. And that is the square dashed logo thing. I’m not even sure if it is the exact final design, but what did you say this was gonna be Robin?\nLike an early\nRobin: first edition.\nTristram: low Yes. First edition before Tris has quite got the logo symmetrical. I’ve been learning Vector illustration using Inkscape, the fantastic open source tool that is in some ways better than an illustrator.\nwe get almost no commission from this. This is more about a fun thing for the community to do to publicly let you set your commission. And I think the price is already, like the base price is already, correct for that sort of thing. I’ve set it as low as possible.\nTo support us, Patreon is the best option, but you also don’t need to do a thing. You can just keep listening, keep recommending things to your friends. As I said in episode one, this is the only way podcasts can work is word of mouth. There’s no algorithms. Although I have now submitted the show to about a dozen different podcast indexes and stores and so forth.\nI think we’re gonna talk about feedback.\nyes.\nRobin: about the fact that this is we’re, we are doing this together with the user,I thought that would be a beautiful segue into talking about feedback because that’s how, it’s two way.\nTristram: Right, well Reminded. So there are a few ways you can give us feedback, but the best way for our organization, and so that I see it and Robin sees it and we both can be involved in the conversation, is on the website to capsulate.com. If you go through to each individual episode in addition to the full transcript, we’ll go about that later.\nIn addition to the full transcript, at the very bottom of the page, there is a comment box, but this comment box is powered by GitHub discussions. So this has a huge advantage in that all of the discussion is actually in one place. If you look at the discussions on GitHub, you can search through them, you can attach files, you can write in markdown, all of the good stuff that we have come to expect from GitHub.\nBut it’s also this nice little comment box. And this is powered by Guus, G-I-S-C-S app, which is an open source GitHub discussions comment system. Really happy about that. And most importantly, probably for the listener, this emails me when you comment. Now, it may or may not email Robin. Your notification settings are your own, but I will at least see it\nRobin: No, I\nTristram: we can chat about it.\nRobin: my notifications for it. I hadn’t thought of that yet, but I’ll make sure I do it.\nTristram: Yeah, selective notifications. I’m a big fan of notifications off by default in general, but turning on very important things, like your partner your teachers, that sort of thing. So if you’re listening to this, that’s how to give us feedback at the bottom of the episode page on the main site, comment using the discuss or go straight to the repo if you’re familiar with GitHub, and start making some new threads.\nGive us some suggestions, some [00:05:00] corrections or whatever. There were quite a lot of mistakes in the episode one video I used descrip, which is what we’re using to record this and do the initial edit which is a great tool.\nThe problem is it makes mistakes into the video, and I can’t fix them because YouTube do not let you, do not let you make changes or re-upload a video. I think it is possible. If you are a very fancy YouTuber, like millions of subscribers and you’ve got a personal connection to a YouTube manager or something, you can beg them to do a re-upload\nBut that is not for mere mortals like us. I dunno if I’ve ever told you my theory, Robin, about why YouTube doesn’t let you edit videos, which is strange.\nRobin: No I don’t think so.\nWe’ve immediately gone off topic, but I think it is, it’ll be interesting to our listeners at least. Let’s try and keep it short.\nTristram: Yeah, exactly. We got stuff to get through. The, I think the biggest reason that YouTube do not let you edit your videos is not for like fraud reasons so that you could get a load of videos and then change the video to make it look like people liked something that it wasn’t or anything like that.\nIt is because as with everything Google Do, it all comes back for advertising. The way advertising works in podcasts is that Robin and I could approach a podcast advertising network and they could splice in their adverts into parts of our episodes. I really. Don’t think we will do that for advertising, because I personally hate those.\nI prefer host red ads, but it is possible to automate this and keep things fresh so that you listen to it one week, you get one ad, you listen to it. The next week you get the more updated ad, which is presumably better for everyone. YouTube runs their own ad platform, and if they let you edit your video, they would let in competing ad platforms\nRobin: Oh,\nTristram: because you could splice your own ads later on into videos.\nYou see what I mean?\nRobin: People do put ads in videos anyway, but you are saying they can’t be changed after you’ve put them in\nTristram: Yes. That’s a big feature of these podcast ad networks is that they will keep your ads up to date, which increases yield for everyone,\nRobin: yeah.\nTristram: I feel that is a problem for podcasting, at least in the way I’d want to do it, because people give over their podcast to these advertising networks to then put these ads in between. And I think often, I particularly listened to quite a lot of leftist, political shows\nAspace communism shows. Yes, I know.\nRobin: and there’s quite a lot of things like, so I was listening to like the intercepted podcast, and only adverts in this podcast at the beginning of the end were two. British voiced, and therefore, not very clearly notfrom the original feed for Starbucks. And a big a big topic of intercepted in general is like Gaza and Israel and Palestine and all that kind of stuff.\nAnd Starbucks are one of the, one of the boycott targets. So it was rather jarring, I sent\nTristram: oh.\nRobin: about it but you lose control of exactly what adverts on your podcast, which concerns me a bit.\nTristram: I would like to promise to the listener at this stage that we will never do something like that and we will run Host Red Ads if and when we are lucky enough to be able to get income through the show. It will be Host Red Ads by Robin and me from companies that we genuinely love and are not like destroying the planet.\nAnd if you disagree, Robin will delete this from the edit and nobody will ever hear this, but I bet you agree.\nRobin: I certainly agree.\nTristram: Good, good.\nDigital Gardening\nTristram: Have I got a great, wonderful little slice of what kind of feels like the cozy internet for you. So I’ll start off with some definitions. Digital gardening is a way of working in the open. So instead of working on a, let’s say, a blog post for many months and getting it all perfect and then publishing it,\nRobin: Who could you be referring to?\nTristram: Anyone, anyone could do this perfectionism is a great curse in our society instead of working on that privately and trying to get it as good as you can.\nDigital gardening is where you work in the open in a interconnected series of notes and you potter by which I mean you do a little here, do a little there. You’ve got a lot of ideas, a lot of documents, a lot of posts, a lot of thoughts, half done, and you bounce between them, improving them all\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: bits.\nRobin: you do a little bit of weeding here. You kinda bend this round so it can\nTristram: That’s it.\nRobin: To the vine. To, to the like trellis a bit better over there,\nTristram: ah, the dream.\nRobin: a while. Yeah.\nTristram: It is absolute hobbit core. Publishing, like very cozy, very just a dream. It feels very much like the scrappy websites of old, they were always under construction, weren’t they? You never have an under construction website. Now it’s always, this is my perfect brand.\nPlease subscribe to my substack. It’s very polished and boring. if you were to visit a digital garden [00:10:00] like namtao.com, the first thing you’ll see is not posts reverse chronological lauder, like a blog. If you’ll excuse me, like if you go to robin winslow.co uk,\nRobin: Oof calling me\nTristram: uh,\nRobin: Oh\nTristram: I’m not saying that is bad.\nI’m saying you have got a blog, whereas a digital garden is a web of linked pages,\nRobin: yeah.\nTristram: very much like what the web was designed for. The clue is in the name. It’s not a timeline, which are, I dunno about you, but I am real tired of timelines these days. But it’s more something that you’ve gotta explore.\nThings aren’t super signposted. You might have to go to one page, then another, and then circle back and get lost a little bit. It’s not very monetizable. It’s not very contenty but it is lovely. That is digital gardening. I will make sure in the show notes we’ve got a link to Maggie Appleton’s page on the history and ethos of the digital garden, I believe is what that is called.\nDigital gardening. There’s a lot of videos on YouTube of people who’ve taken up digital gardening who were inspired by Maggie’s amazing blog post In it be very cleverly signposts. How finished each page on her site is by describing them as seedlings ideas that have been planted buds, the seeds that are started sprouting and trees maybe, fully formed ideas that she,\nRobin: is so amazing. This is like exactly what I need.\nTristram: I knew it would be. That’s why I’ve brought it here for you. So this is lovely. This is exactly what you want and it fits really nicely into obsidian namtao.com is based on the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin, which lets you put in the front matter a checklist that says, Hey, publish this page, and then handles all of the linking, uploading of images.\nAnd it even supports like mermaid diagrams and incredibly obsidian data view, which is a third party plugin, not core to obsidian, but it might as well be core to obsidian. It’s very nice. perhaps I’ll find a few other examples of digital gardens.\nRobin: So sorry, what’s the relationship between namta.com and obsidian?\nTristram: namta.com is created from markdown documents inside my obsidian fault.\nRobin: So it’s created for markdown documents in the same way that any static site is. Is there like tech, as in from that markdown that leads to the website. Does that share anything with obsidian or is it just two different systems?\nTristram: It\nRobin: the same\nTristram: is extreme. It’s extremely deeply integrated. There is an obsidian plugin called Digital Garden, and this gives you like a command in obsidian to publish single pages or all pages that have the checkbox DG publish in the properties in the MET data.\nAnd this pushes up to GitHub using the GitHub, API not.\nUsing Git. The command line uses the GitHub, API, to directly add these files to the repo. This is clever ’cause it means it works on mobile where you don’t have access to the Git client. So it uses the GitHub, API to push these files there. And then on the GitHub side, there is a GitHub action, which crunches those markdown files into a website like any other static site generator.\nIt’s just that these are designed to work together. You just, clone and copy their repo and just get going. so the advantage of this over a more traditional static site generator is that in a traditional static site generator, you can have unpublished markdown, but it has to be in the GitHub repo.\nIt might have a little checklist that says, don’t, this is a draft, but it’s still in public. People can still look at it on the GitHub repo\nRobin: But with the digital garden plugin, you keep all your notes private in your obsidian vault, which can be private on Dropbox using obsidian sync, whatever you like. And you only push the documents as you want to make them public.\nSorry. Not by putting ’em in a folder\nTristram: no by putting this front matter property called DG Publish. And it’s a Boolean True. False.\nRobin: puts it in gi.\nTristram: Exactly.\nSo it’s just what I was looking for because I want all of namtao.com, which has my video scripts and everything, including lost terminal scripts, lost terminal characters.\nLike everything. I like it. It’s the whole thing for all of my projects. I want those to also be on GitHub in markdown, that people can give me poor requests for if I make mistakes or if they want to improve them or whatever.\nbut I also wanted privacy because this is just my normal vault with obsidian.\none of the big rules that I learned very early on is don’t have multiple vaults, have one vault and figure it out.\nRobin: yeah.\nTristram: Because interlinking is what we’re doing here. I didn’t expect such a strong reaction from you, Robin, but I’m delighted. ’cause this, in hindsight, this is exactly what you need, right?\nRobin: I was actually, I was finding it quite funny when you said because it uses the gout API, [00:15:00] therefore it works on mobile and it might seem like such a trivial point unless you’ve tried to do this thing of to like, I don’t know, blog on the train on your phone or whatever. it’s so important. it’s such a centrally important feature. I can’t even it’s, yeah. Anyway, sorry. how long have you been keeping this from me?\nTristram: Maybe\nsix months.\nI can only apologize.\nRobin: it.\nTristram: Look, it actually gets better\nRobin: acceptable.\nTristram: the heading I’ve got for this section is digital gardening and Aze Carston. So I’ve realized that they are the same thing. I don’t think I’m the first person to figure this out,\nRobin: Yes.\nTristram: but they’re extremely. Compatible because in z Augustine, you take your fleeting notes and thoughts, ideas that you’ve had by while reading or listening or watching something, and you process them into permanent notes sometimes called atomic notes.\nAnd these are single units of teachable knowledge. And they let me have a look at my atomic notes. So I’ve got an atomic note that says, using copilot GPT to automate the easy stuff is the opposite of doing code cutters. And that sort of single thread, that single idea struck out of some ideas I had whilst watching some videos or reading stuff or just like doing the dishes or whatever.\nAnd I filtered it through and made this atomic note. Now that is not a blog post, but it also is something that I was happy enough to post on Mastodon perhaps a month or so ago. And so there’s something between a thought that you have had and a blog post and sometimes that’s\nRobin: blog post.\nTristram: Exactly. So there’s this continuum and I think that you don’t actually need to. Post these things on Twitter or Mastodon, you could have them on your digital garden ready for people to browse through if you are happy with these atomic ideas. And they’re not too private. But if they’re well fleshed out and you’ve got some references, as usually happens when you’re making these robust atomic notes, they’re naturally branched.\nThey’re naturally linking to each other. They flow through and ideas string themselves together. And you get like a sequence of atomic notes that build upon each other. Let’s look at that atomic note. Using copilot to automate the easy stuff is the opposite. Getting code casters.\nI’ve got a note before that says, AI can only reduce complexity, and those are linked threaded through. And so that one idea follows another, and they eventually, if I kept adding on thoughts to this string of ideas, this string of atomic notes, if I kept stringing more and more together, I might eventually have a video.\nA video script or a blog post idea. this is literally how my last AI video happened. I just had these little ideas that came together and I developed them and I built them into atomic notes that I was pretty pleased with. They seemed to stand alone on their own, and I strung them together.\nAnd eventually I had the outline of my script. AI is Not for You. Which is a few videos ago, and it feels like I could probably do this in public, in my digital garden. I could publish my atomic notes with links between them and people could browse around and find a little bit of meaning for themselves should they wish to.\nRobin: Yeah, this is what I’ve always wanted to do, and some have never found the structure that supports it ish. Like I’m not very private and I don’t really want to be very private. And I believe in openness and I would love it if, I think also you don’t need to, general, you don’t really need to be scared of putting things out there because a lot of people who don’t publish, and this might be a thing that changes with the new TikTok generation or whatever, but like people who don’t publish, can be very scared of outputting anything at all. when you actually start to do it, I think you realize that there’s so much information out there that nobody cares. Like predominantly nobody cares. Like you have to be quite,\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: Known or say saying something interesting in some way for anybody to care, right?\nSo for the most part it’s gonna just it’s inconsequential and so you don’t need to be scared of it. so I would love to be able to do exactly what you’re saying and throw up small thoughts. have a structure for them to be drawn together into larger thoughts.\nSomething that I think possibly I would distress me when you try and turn it into a website is like in obsidian, obviously I can create whatever mess I like because it’s only for me to come back to right\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: online. I feel a certain obligation to try and avoid link rot, right? If I had a fleeting thought that I throw up in someplace that you can find through looking through my website, and then someone finds it and they find it interesting, but then later I want to evolve it into something a bit bigger.\nAnd so therefore I might turn that into this other thing. And that old thing might be gone now it’s a 4 0 4, right?\nTristram: I’ve got an answer for you,\nRobin: would concern me.\nTristram: I’ve got an answer for you. If you’re using a robust [00:20:00] tool like obsidian, it renames links as you rename pages, and I admit that doesn’t solve deleting a page, you’ll then end up with a broken link there. But it’s not without a modicum of control.\nAs long as you don’t expect like a, I would imagine you’re not thinking of, oh, ha, having a 4 0 4 when I delete a page, that’s actually very normal.\nYou’re worried about having a 4 0 4,\nRobin: Sure.\nTristram: right? You are worried about it like somehow links breaking when you move things around. Obsidian solves that by keeping all links working.\nRobin: Does it, as in, it’s not on obsidian, like the, what did you call it? Is it called digital garden?\nTristram: It is just called the digital garden plugin.\nRobin: it is the digital garden plugin that’s gonna have to take care of it because something has to be listening for requests and turn them into three oh twos or three oh ones, right?\nLike\nObsidian\nTristram: yes.\nRobin: that.\nTristram: What the plugin does is every time you publish it. Uses all of the links as they are currently in your obsidian vault. So if the links in your obsidian vault are still working, they will still work on the website.\nSo you\nRobin: expecting links to break. What I’m saying is bookmarks will break\nTristram: Ah I see. So if I move something around, if I change its name, somebody will link to my site and it will no longer be there. Great.\nRobin: yeah\nTristram: okay. so there are two ways to think about this. The first one is that there’s a method in just like in many static site generators, you can throw something into the front matter that says link slug or link URL or whatever.\nAnd then you’ve got yourself a permanent link. So no matter where you change the do, that’s all fine. Problem solved.\nRobin: Second option is that the very nature of the digital garden is that things are a little bit in flux, but because we are not separating this out into a thing that is all public and a thing that is all private, because it’s blended, we have got a much more granular way of doing things.\nTristram: If you go to namtao.com and the first option is no Boilerplates, and if you click read more, the ur l is namtao.com/nb. My digital gardenmy obsidian note for that is not called nb. It’s called something like No Boilerplate Home,\nBut I’ve got this perma link called nb, and then in the video section I’ve got some of my videos listed.\nEach of those videos also has a PERMA link, because I think I’m very likely to link those from outside. But if you go back into something more relaxed, like lost Terminal, everything under, so Lost Terminal is nta com slash lt. That’s a perma link, but everything under it is dynamic because I.\nWant the freedom to just move things around, change characters, names, change where people live, change the whole topography of it. But you’ll still be able to go to the lost terminal section of my garden because I’ve made a little, I dunno what the metaphor should be. A stone archway that says Abandon or hope.\nNo. The opposite. Get some hope.\nSo it’s read more under the lost terminals section on the front page. If you click read more at the bottom of that Green Hope punk sci-fi.\nRobin: so it’s the read more and the fact that you’ve got an LT slash which you’re\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: archway. And then you’re saying within this things move around, which means that if I click on LT season oh eight, or I’m trying to figure out what I could, okay, so you’ve got a note, you’ve got a keratin note section, right? So if I clicked on one of these, for example volunteer or whatever, and which is empty, for example. But let’s say you’ve written a few sentences in there, but then you decide to change her name. You are just saying there’s no promise that you’d necessarily find that it was here if you came back here.\nTristram: Am saying that there is a granular promise you can expect my garden to have a lost terminal section. In 10 years time, you can very reasonably visit my house, come into my garden and say, oh, I remember this lost terminal section. It’s the same place that I’ve, I remember it, but look at all these new flowers you’ve planted, and those, some of those old flowers, some of those old shrubs have moved.\nWhere’s that old oak tree? Oh, you cut it down.\nLike I don’t like, I know that cool URLs don’t change, but there is a gotta be some granularity to that binary when it, when in the digital garden\nRobin: to recti because, ’cause I love HTPI love the internet. I love the fundamental\nTristram: should.\nRobin: Of the internet. And I suppose I feel like spiritually what you’re describing here is a bit the essence of what we think the internet should be like.\nAs in pure internet is the one where people are represented by their own domains rather than through\nSome, conglomerate. In those domains they have, freedom of expression. You get to come along and experience the things that they wanna put out there. Freely. Because I feel like. The core standards of the internet and this idea of your own digital garden of self-expression are so overlapping. Like that’s what the internet’s there to enable. trying to therefore [00:25:00] reconcile some of the standards, with this vision, but I think you’re right that it’s probably just that I’m being too precious about broken links.\nThere are ones that you can rely on and\nAre ones you can’t, and obviously you can make your 4 0 4 page helpful, right? So yeah. So I think it’s a point that we don’t need to focus on anymore, but I just, I, that’s where my mind went. But\nTristram: one of the things that you might be able to do is advance the signposting of each ’cause currently I’m breaking a rule of digital gardening that I’ve not signposted which of these pages are in progress and which of these progress are more like our buds or seedlings or trees or, I forget exactly.\nSo you could say when it is at the highest level of confidence, it gets a permalink.\nRobin: yeah. Like a tree with a, it is a good metaphor because a.\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: A tree, you don’t expect to disappear.\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: down a\nSacrilege, right?\nTristram: Yes. The tree is gonna survive a hurricane, potentially.\nRobin: Might not that,\nTristram: Maybe. Yeah. A storm. Certainly. Drought, perhaps. Yeah, exactly. I do. You’d like it?\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: I do.\nRobin: I do and I will be playing with it also not very happy with the fact that my blog is a completely, inaccessible, chronological list. And I think it should be much more thematic and it doesn’t need to be neat. Like it could absolutely just be, I want you to be able to meander through it by topic, and I just haven’t made it like that, because I, in a way, I’m a bit too vain like I was really proud of the styling of my blog because it’s supposed to be elegant and usable straightforward and it’s, yeah, like the text is big enough.\nit doesn’t use more colors than it needs. But it’s, trying to be elegant and make it as easy to read the content and access content as possible. in that mission it’s a bit like also the thing that blocks me from throwing content up because I’m being too perfectionist about it,\nthat’s why it’s not messy in the way that I think actually would be a much better representation me. So I will be, I hope I will find the time quite soon to recraft my blog as a digital garden because I love the idea.\nTristram: I love the idea is good.\nRobin: keeping it from me for six months.\nTristram: I’m so sorry. It’s pretty cool. like every morning I do two hours of pottering before I get into my lost terminal writing.\nRobin: it’s just.\nTristram: I just, and I literally very often will wake up before my alarm. Really excited to go do that because\nI’ve blended my ze casting knowledge base, my project management and my digital garden all into one thing. And I like it’s like I’m gonna be working on all of this at the same time, without any real goal, but just knowing that I’m increasing the progress on lots of little things that are important to my life in this system.\nIt’s just the best thing ever.\nRobin: That’s amazing. If you succeed in turning me into a sort of constant gardener of my website, I feel a bit like you’ll have saved my life. Like, I feel like I’m I’m I just, I don’t have the, I think I don’t have the space, the freedom to just in that way and everything is yeah. I would love that. if I could just, go and spend half an hour wandering through my web garden and pruning it and helping a bit grow here every day. That would be amazing.\nTristram: There we go. we’ll see how much of that we’re comfortable keeping in, but that was lovely. Let’s press on.\nOkay.\nme about Tess Riel.\nRobin: Qui, yes, it’s a little bit of an ungainly title for a topic. So do you know fundamentally who Tim, Nick Gabriel is?\nTristram: No.\nRobin: You may do, when I explain who she is timber Gabriel was a she worked for Google\nAnd she was in the AI safety I think, and she published a paper, which is this stochastic parrots paper. heard of the term stochastic parrots? It’s a description of LLM generative AI systems.\nTristram: Oh, of course it is. Yeah, that makes sense.\nso she, the paper basically says that AI is harmfulSure.\nRobin: making some points about safety and things that Google should focus on.\nAnd she was fired. And she very cleverly made use of fired by Google in her personal branding, I think.\nTristram: That’ll do it.\nRobin: but she set up a research company after that. And then she worked with this philosopher called Emily Lee, or Emil, I dunno how to pronounce it p Torres. And they came up with this term, tere. I think why this is interesting is because you have to ask yourself, given that AI has had many different meanings, but at the moment is these generative sort of lamb based, algorithms.\nTristram: Huh.\nRobin: if you understand, how incapable they are of solving many of the problems that people claim that they can solve, you have to ask yourself the question, how come so many incredibly wealthy investors have [00:30:00] put so much money into developing these AI systems? What is it that leads to that happening? Like was this an obsession of Silicon Valley? Why did people, represent such a significant fantasy that then diverted, and trillions of dollars and completely transformed the American economy through doing that based on the production of systems which were not gonna get anywhere near delivering on their stated\nTristram: right.\nRobin: And so to answer that question, they’ve gone explored the ideology of the people who might invest. of the AI believers, the AI boosters and the, and particularly the AI investors, and so I suppose this is the reveal. TES real stands for transhumanism Exrop, pianism singularitarian, cosmism rationalism, rationalist ideology. Effective altruism and long-termism. And they draw out through this paper, which I would recommend if anybody is actually interested enough to read it. It is an easy to read paper. It’s very well written, and it’s not long. But it lays out the links between all of these overlapping ideologies and how they lead together. How significant advocacy or belief in these ideologies the line, the through line that links all of the different, aI boosters who have pushed the idea that we are heading for an AI apocalypse or that there’s the AI is this powerful thing that’s gonna take over the world that we really need to or that it’s gonna transform or it’s gonna be the thing that’s inevitably gonna transform humanity and save all the lives.\nLike all these people who are pushing all of those fantasies that really cannot flow from, if you understand what in fact an LLM based generative algorithm is, right?\nTristram: Yeah. It’s also correct. Trained on the internet.\nRobin: those, this bucket of ideologies is what pushes it. And you can trace it all the way through.\nSo the word that draws all these ideologies together, you could say as eugenics, because it’s basically an idea that you can craft yourself through whatever mechanisms, through manipulating things. You’re trying to build yourself a sort of perfect model human or a perfect model being that’s able to like, transcend humanity. and it’s similar to what eugenicists, would’ve been doing with the Arian race in Nazi Germany. There was a lot of long history of eugenics thought that. Eugenics was. The idea that there was racial traits in racial superiority was held as a scientific truth for a surprising amount of 20th century, right?\nNot just focused around the 19 19th, thirties I’d say extending significantly beyondand it sort of infected the way that people thought about lots of different things. But this is the thread that ties all together.\nSo I just firstly, I think it’s really interesting to ask that question like, what happened in humanity that led to so much investment of such a significant sum of all of the product of humanity being invested in this complete fantasy, right?\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: that’s a really interesting question to ask.\nAnd then I think the answer is really interesting that these ideas really overlap and they’re all linked and they’re linked through this belief that you can transcend all of the flaws of humanity in this like creation. And they just believe in that so strongly that they will look for evidence and they will find every opportunity to reinforce it without asking too many questions. Do you know what I mean?\nTristram: Right.\nRobin: think it’s really amazing.\nTristram: That I admit, I don’t know very much about this entire space. Other than the small bits about transhumanism and\nwhat were the other, what were the other bits that, that\nRobin: altruism, long-termism?\nTristram: yes. Like it’s always easier to imagine helping a future person than actually give money to a homeless person today. I don’t think of them particularly highly\nRobin: yes.\nTristram: of altruism people quite apart from that crypto, bro.\nRobin: journey of effective altruism, I think is fascinating because and it’s significantly based around Sam, Bankman Frees, that’s name, I think, right?\nTristram: Yes. Not the best poster child for it. Yeah.\nRobin: But like effect altruism in its founding, I think was at least interesting.\nSo there’s, I can’t remember his full name, but there’s a guy called Peter, someone who’s like a philosopher. I think he was probably Oxford or something like that. and he’s sort of the founder or one of the fathers of this movement. And he’s basically saying, if you really try and quantify your altruism. Then you’ll see that you might think that you could help a homeless person in your city, but if you live in the west and you send that money to Africa, you could save way more lives. That’s quite an interesting basis. So that’s where you start.\nIf we were to follow that through and we were to calculate the different ways in which we could actually increase the way that we could help people, then that would be better because we could work out how to help more people. The thing is that then led, like [00:35:00] where that led is insane.\nSo the first insane place that people start to say, this is what Sam b for free did I think I’m gonna get a job in finance so I can make more money and then I can give it away.\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: and now there’s and that then obviously led to basically the most egregious and largest version.\nI, I, what’s the right term? I don’t know if money laundering is the right term, but it’s the\nTristram: Raw was it\nRobin: It is fraud, but it’s like this the inventing of money, the passing around between companies that are supposed to be independent. They’re like, yeah, just like writing fake numbers into books.\nIt’s exactly all the same stuff that like Enron was doing\nTristram: is. Is that securities fraud?\nRobin: Probably, yeah.\nTristram: Is that what that is?\nRobin: would, would’ve been doing securities fraud. But like all of this stuff was justified\nMind, I think because he’s I am, I’m a good place to be given a lot of money because I’m gonna be giving it away.\nAnd I think he did give a lot of money away to some good causes, but would be arguable whether they were better causes than like other people with the money you might have given it to. So I don’t know, but like that, that the first thing is this idea that you can therefore get like one of the most unethical jobs just because you’re making a lot of money and then you give it away as like a way to do good, which seems pretty suspect to me in the first place. then obviously the other place EA goes, which is just absolutely nuts, is the idea of future, as you say, future lives versus present lives. Like we are going to imagine some kind of future where there’s a lot more humans and those ones would be hurt by, this thing. And they don’t turn it to climate change.\nThis is the really mind boggling thing. So\nTristram: oh no,\nRobin: they don’t use it as an argument for climate change. They use it as an argument for why they have to explore into planetary travel or again, ai, right? We need ai ’cause it’ll save us from climate change. I guess there might be a bit of a climate change argument there, but you do it through ai.\nLike the only way to solve climate change is to invest in ai, I think. Have you heard that argument?\nTristram: I have not. I would not believe it if somebody made it to me.\nRobin: exists. This is definitely an\nTristram: Ugh.\nRobin: people make.\nTristram: It does seem it’s the perfect ethos for an investor for whom every tomorrow is worth the unethical practices of today. Like it lines up perfectly with being somebody who just wants to see the number go up. And if someone’s telling you that, oh, that’s ethical. Marvelous. What a dream,\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: I’m so happy for them.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. I think that’s exactly right. I think what’s interesting about this paper as well, is that she’s saying like on the left, where we recognize that capitalism is destructive, right?\nEasy, therefore to say everything is the fault of capitalism. So all these people who are doing toxic things, they’re doing it because they’re driven by a pro profit motive. Now, I don’t think that’s true because I think that once you get beyond a certain level of wealth, the wealth no longer, may matter to you in some small time way.\nLike you might want to keep your status as a trillionaire, right? So that you don’t lose face against your. Buddy you are competing with or whatever, right?\nTristram: Right.\nRobin: broadly speaking, that’s not your big driver. big driver is something else. It’s something ideological, right? It’s not, I’m just doing everything because it makes me more money. I think you will inevitably be trying to make more money because you employ people who make sure that’s gonna be the case and whatever. They make smart investments. So what you are saying about being able to make an argument through effective altruism about investment, I think is right?\nLike about it being good investment is right. But I think the thing about test reel is it explains the really impactful thing is are the people that have all the money, that have all the power and their actual driver is something else, right? So what is their actual driver? these are to draw that out. Do you see what I mean?\nTristram: It does. It sounds like I should read the paper to find that out. it does, it draws a thread between all of these different kinds people and explains what links them all and what motivates all of these different groups?\nIs that, did I get that right?\nRobin: Yeah. I mean it’s basically saying they’re overlapping. It’s saying that there’s actually a bit of a journey between them. But if you look at some of the people you might draw out, so you’ve got obviously SBF, you’ve got Sam Altman, you’ve got Hinton, Jeffrey Hinton.\nYou’ve got so all these AI boosters, if you inspect their ideologies, you find that they include some subset of this bucket and they overlap quite significantly. Do you see what I mean? and they evidence this, I think they, put it quite clearly to show that these are, defining beliefs of the set of people that are responsible for this direction in technology investment.\nTristram: Interesting.\nRobin: Yeah, that’s the topic. I find it fascinating. I bring it to you, I suppose a little bit because I feel like broadly speaking, it’s my kind of thing and not your kind of thing. But I wanna see how interested you are in it. ’cause I love, sociology and philosophy and ideas and ideologies.\nAnd also I guess bad people, understanding the things that harm us or lead us astray. Yeah.\nTristram: It’s, I have been very interested in, thank you very much for explaining this to me and I hope some of our listeners will find it useful as well. the [00:40:00] thing that. I am left with is that it’s wild. They didn’t want to solve climate change. Like the is such a low hanging fruit.\nRobin: Yeah. as an overall statement that might not be fair. It’s just that there might be people there that really care about it, but SBF probably cared about it. It is just the way that he would want to go about it as suspect, maybe, I don’t know.\nI dunno enough really just to comment.\nTristram: You certainly, don’t need to invest in space travel\nRobin: yeah, certainly.\nTristram: Like you, the there is a very clear order of things to fix and space travel is not on that list.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: It’s like that is not to say that weather satellites are not very useful in combating climate change, but like space tourism probably not\nRobin: certainly. No, that’s, but it’s the idea of planetary escape, isn’t it?\nTristram: right?\nRobin: that one version, I suppose it’s if you try and map this out, and this is what these clever people do, and they clever, clever brains, right? Is you are like, look. Let’s say there’s a 30% chance that we fail to save the planet, and climate change destroys it and makes it completely uninhabitable, right? it’s an ethical good to save the human race, so therefore we should be investing some amount of money in the ability to move to Mars. Do you see what I mean?\nTristram: Yeah. It’s a preposterous argument. Mars is not very habitable, like even the worst ravages. I’m I think I, we’re now in my wheelhouse. ’cause we’re talking about a post environmental apocalypse, which is all I write about in Lost Terminal. I do a huge amount of research to try and make it right.\nEven like the most grim, awful predictions don’t involve the planet. Not having any oceans. Mars doesn’t have any oceans. even if there is a catastrophe, like the, it’s actually the opposite problem. The ocean is gonna bring the party to us. It’s not that the ocean’s gonna go away, it’s gonna have too much ocean.\nRobin: yeah.\nTristram: Like in Lost terminal, in my story, 10 meters sea level rise is what I chose in 2020. That was a wildly optimistic thing. In hindsight actually, we’re like, that would be, if every country immediately changed what they were doing and focused on climate change, we might only have 10 meters of sea level to rise.\nI apologize in advance. For\nRobin: a fact to drop, isn’t it?\nTristram: I’m sorry. I, especially, I’m sorry for our Dutch listenersWhen I think Amsterdam is three meters below sea level it’s gonna be a bad time for Hitachi friends. Which is especially sad because I believe that the Netherlands on the whole are amazing at investing ingood climate policies and so forth.\nCertainly they’ve got the first iron powered brewery. So it’s like carbon neutral because they’re burning iron. I cannot go off topic about how much I love the Netherlands. Yeah, it’s cool.\nRobin: I think it brings a little bit of wholesomeness to my topic\nTristram: We should just like solve climate change. It’s much\nRobin: It\nTristram: like.\nRobin: saying is yes, obviously we need to solve climate change if we’re gonna stay here, but also the best solving of climate change still means we’re going to have massive challenges in terms of environmental changes. And so therefore we have to solve climate change and work out how to deal with the changing environment.\nTristram: Having a\nRobin: right?\nTristram: Yes, having Planet two is a great idea. That doesn’t remove Planet one, right? Like Planet one will still exist in this hypothetical utopia where we’ve become a multi-plan species. Like the solution is not, ignore the first planet with, conservatively 10 billion people on.\nThat doesn’t sound good, but it does sound good to the kind of person who imagines themselves going to planet\nRobin: yeah. But it’s not just that they, the thing that I think is commonthe through line is that it’s the fantasy of it. Like I’ve always been struck\nThat the people who claim to be Our smartest, leaders, right? Have such a huge fantasy element to them. You know what I mean?\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: all sorts of nonsense and then trying to make the world make that true for them, which is why I think the ideology thing is such a good point. It’s like ideologies are so defining.\nI found this in the way that like Elon Musk complains about population decline in the US but none of his solutions make any sense, right? it’s so hard to figure out why the hell these people who presumably have an education and claim to be really smart can continually seem to be making such obvious, logical errors.\nYou know what you’re talking about it’s there’s Musk, there’s loads of stuff that loads of people think he’s really smart and they think he’s a genius until you are actually an engineer. It’s that thing about, if you read an article in a publication in your area you realize how inaccurate it is, and then everything else you hear, you think it’s accurate still, right?\nTristram: Yeah, so that’s the gelman amnesia effect.\nRobin: Exactly. And that’s what baffles me about\nTristram: is it really baffling or is it that people will latch onto an ideology that already confirms what they already know to be true? If you’ve got a religion that says that. You are, you’re okay. You are born into the right thing. You are the right people. You’ve got the right [00:45:00] tribe.\nPeople who are outside your tribe are wrong. That’s extremely persuasive. That’s extremely easy to be loved into. And if you’ve got something like effective altruism, which confirms your existing belief that you didn’t pay anyone anything, you should try to squeeze everyone around you for all the money, and you save it all.\nThat’s perfectly aligned because you will perhaps notionally save the money for some hypothetical future where you’ll be able to save a billion, billion people. And therefore, what you’re doing is ethical. That’s extremely convenient that it aligned with the values you already had. You didn’t have to change your mind about anything.\nRobin: Yeah. But the thing about I, I don’t think following the money gets you there is because the fundamental thing about AI is that so many people who have invested so much hopeless dead ends, right? Like that’s the thing about it is like Elon Musk said, the only possible way to justify Tesla’s share price if. Become self-driving cars, right? that would explode the company’s value. And the share price would be justified. the only reason why people pay that amount in Elon Musk’s, whatever is because they believe that might happen or that will happen. And it’s not going to\nTristram: no, I, this is is this a post hoc argument? It’s just like circular argument. It’s rubbish.\nLet, we must close this topic down and I will finish by looping us back to the idea of planet two space explosion and so forth\nI forget who said this, everybody should go to space.\nNot everyone should return,\nRobin: We’ll go from a conversation about terrible things to do with ai into good ai, I believe is what you’re gonna tell us about, isn’t it? Tris?\nTristram: Yes. And I do hope the listeners stick with me for this. Don’t immediately say off. It should be very obvious by now that I’m an extreme AI skeptic. I made a t-shirt that said, don’t talk to me about ai. Like it should be very obvious. However, there are plenty of good uses for.\nLarge language models, and they’re all to do with very specific language features and so forth. Here is one that was impressed upon me by Amos. I’m sure they won’t mind me saying this, Amos from Faster Than Limea really good YouTuber and much better than I article writer. And now my collaborator ammos did a little bit of tweaking the website whilst I could see their shared screen.\nAnd what Ammos was doing was using the Z editor combined with copilot like you can do, and did a little bit of what we would call derogatory vibe coding on the website. These were like some low level tweaks, like change this name everywhere, like small refactorings, like almost doesn’t need AI to code.\nBut this was like just we were doing something else and this was a really low priority thing. So fine, not my cup of tea, but it was okay. Here is where it astounded me. Ammos was using voice typing to instruct copilot inside of Zed. What to do. And this made me realize that actually there is a good use here.\nRobin: Can I\nTristram: be\nRobin: can I jump in for a second and\nTristram: please\nRobin: a point of clarification. I know what copilot is.\nTristram: So Zed is a relatively modern new programming editor. It’s got the two main features that come to the front of my mind when I think about Z is one.\nRobin: I,\nTristram: written in HTML and electron like VS. Code is, it’s written in native rust, which makes it extremely fast.\nLike you think vs. Code is nippy enough, but that’s because we’re used to it. The speed is a feature.\nRobin: okay.\nTristram: the second one is that it’s AI first. they’ve got a big AI plan and it’s why I didn’t really take it seriously because as I’ve said, I’m an AI skeptic, but the ability for you to say things like change all of these functions so that they’re wrapped in this other module and then go, if I was typing that it’s less compelling ’cause I’m having to type into an AI coding chat box.\nBut if I’m speaking that. Suddenly we’re doing something that I couldn’t do. And what that thing is, program using my voice, and this is something that recently has become all too important for me as I get RSI which is that ligament problem you have where typing hurts it’s like carpal tunnel that sort of thing.\n’cause last year or maybe two years ago, I got RSI in my fingers, hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, both sides, because I was doing too much, perhaps pottering in my digital garden. I’m joking. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was that I was working for 18 hours all day, every day because I was self-employed.\nAnd you can just blur the lines between business and pleasure. And I really just loved what I was doing. So it seemed like pleasure until six months in my body was like, Hey bro, we are not doing this anymore. So I’m doing much better because I have been lifting weights. That’s my tip for anyone listening [00:50:00] is just go to the gym, lift some weights, buy some weights, lift them.\nThat’s it. that’s all you need to do. At least it worked for me.\nRobin: the\nTristram: I’m not a doctor,\nRobin: this is\nTristram: blah, blah.\nRobin: tangent, but is the RSI in the wrist or where is it?\nTristram: Fingers, hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, bilateral, catastrophic, both sides. Whole arm. Like I’ve got tennis, elbow and wrist and finger problem. Like it was, it happened all at once. Make ’cause my body was like, Hey, you’re not listening to us, so we’re gonna set everything on fire.\nPlease stop working so hard.\nRobin: Wow.\nTristram: yeah, real nightmare. And I’ll be real with you. it is not an overstatement or an exaggeration to say that my A DHD meds gave me RSI. Now that is not, nobody should take away that you shouldn’t take a DHD meds or that they are dangerous.\nBut the line is very clear. A DHD meds allow you to work and focus on what you would like a little easier. That’s wonderful. But what I wanted to do was sit in front of my computer 18 hours a day and type and that is a real problem. Do be careful everyone. Don’t be stupid like your Uncle Tris.\nRobin: I feel like I could divert into a topic psychology that I’m very interested in, but I won’t do it.\nTristram: That’s very generous of you.\nRobin: time.\nTristram: Write it in our notes right now. Robin. Type it in, put ’em in for the next time. So I will turn to Zed and copilot and voice typing. here I had something that I could continue programming and hell probably anything, any kind of text I wasn’t using.\nIt’s a tool that you don’t need to use the generative part of it, you can be extremely prescriptive, but it’s a human computer interface. We already had solved voice recognition like in the nineties. Voice recognition had got to the point where it was great and we’ve now solved the comprehension for simple things.\nYou can’t with copilot. Get it to do complex work, complex refactoring, once your program gets to a certain level of complexity, I have been extremely unimpressed with what I’ve seen, but I’m not talking about that. Those are the problems. If things break down at high levels of complexity, but I’m not trying to replace that.\nI’m just trying to replace typing for the days when I can’t type. Now those are few and far between these days, but being really prescriptive and saying things like those three paragraphs, move them down five lines comment them all out this would be too low level if you were to do this like day to day.\nThis is not what people want with vibe coding. They want make me a website that does x really high level maximum result and that doesn’t work very well, at least after the first prototype. Once you start refining nightmare because you are getting more specific and less general. And LLMs love being general and hate being specific because they’ve not been trained on specifics.\nOr rather they have been trained on specifics but they’ve averaged it out and ground it down into this perfect sphere of unimpressive bullshit. But if you are being very specific and it’s like having that intern who doesn’t really know anything about what they’re doing, but they’re very enthusiastic and they will try to help you wherever they can for somebody who can’t type.\nThat is genius.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/3/","title":"Beginnings, Digital Gardens and AI Delusions"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/4/":{"body":"\n\nRobin talks about the perils of Unit Testing, Tris gives advice to new creators, and both reminisce about The Good Old Days and realise they never left.\n\n📖 CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 The old internet\n26:43 Unit Testing and Calcified Codebases\n42:35 The dangers of being a YouTuber\n\n🔗 LINKS\nOurs\n\nhttps://robinwinslow.uk\nhttps://noboilerplate.org\nhttps://lostterminal.com\nhttps://modemprometheus.com\nhttps://phosphenecatalogue.com\n\nExternal\n\nRuby on Rails\n37signals\nHEY.com\nBrotli (Wikipedia)\nCory Doctorow\nObsidian\nAral Balkan’s “What is the Small Web?”\n\nNote: He doesn’t call it “Web Zero” as Robin suggested.

It was probably about 2005, wasn’t it?\nTris: I dunno. I don’t wanna be, uh, you know, old man shouts to cloud about it. I watched the keynote to Rails World 2024 by David Meyer Hanson, the creator of Ruby on Rails. And it wasn’t intentionally a call to action, but it felt to me personally, like a call to action.\nUh, DHH was saying how you don’t have to use any of the bullshit that modern web development. Is lumbered with, you don’t have to bundle and compile all of your JavaScript. You don’t have to bundle and compile all of your CSS. You don’t have to use a complex reactive framework to compose, uh, reactive HTML components and then render them out into HTML.\nYou can just have some HTML with simple templating. Some JavaScript with native modules, native methods, and some native CSS, which now has enormous. Functionality in the actual old internet, we didn’t have a lot of the features like CSS variables and the ability to have more complex native functionality.\nWe had to use pre-process for everything. The latest version of JavaScript hadn’t got to all of the browsers. So what DHH was saying with all this is that if you were satisfied with web development 10 years ago, all of that is now native in the browser today. You are the front end or the front ender of the two of us.\nDoes that ring true to you?\nRobin: Right. After having actually watched this video, I think I remember you talking about it in our chat group and there were a bunch of things I hadn’t realized Were now native, right? The nesting of CSS. So to me that was one of the big powerful things that SAS gave you. And I, I have the impression that lots and lots of people are still doing it with SaaS under the assumption that.\nYou can’t do it natively, but it works natively. As in if you want to have like a an H one inside a section and you want to give the section some sky styles and then you want to give the H one some styles, you can just nest the H one tag inside the section tag. Right.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: Which you, you, you never used to be able to do and you needed, you needed SaaS for,\nTris: this is exactly what I’m talking about.\nLike we’ve forgotten or we’ve not tried. The native functionality of the browser is even as web developers, we’ve just assumed that we’ve always used these meiers and bundlers and compilers, so we always will have to. Now, there are plenty of future functionality. That we still might want to use compilers and bundlers for, but DHH is like, we’ve reached this threshold, this watershed moment where you, for 99% of websites don’t need any of that.\nYou can just write like the old days, some HTML, some JavaScript and some CSS, native CSS, his example. Was at 37 Signals they’ve recently built last couple of years. They’ve recently built hey.com, which I think is like email for people with A DHD and autism, which is why I love it, and it’s really, really good.\nHe made a wild statement at In This Rails World keynote. He said, the JavaScript we write is the JavaScript that your browser receives. It’s a one-to-one. There’s no like line framework. Yeah, there’s no framework but there, but there’s not even any bundling up. So if you get an error on line five, it’s actually line five on the developer’s machine as well as in production.\nYeah. Like it’s line five of this file. Yeah. Which is wonderful.\nRobin: I’ve always wanted that and I’ve always been frustrated by all of these different tricks that people use to try and optimize their their HTML putting like JavaScript at the end and all this kind of thing. And I was excited when HTTP two came along because.\nOn the face of it, it looked like it was going to solve a lot of that stuff because, well, first of all, you can. Hold a connection open and it will send stuff through it, and then also you can write your framework so that it will bundle the resources needed by a webpage along with the webpage. It turned out, in fact, the configuration of all of that to work really neatly was quite difficult.\nIt might be that since I was looking into it, it’s actually got smarter, but I always felt that there was a significant value in literally just sending people. The most readable form of the JavaScripts and all that kind of thing because everything now is probably compressed with bro anyway, when it’s sent over an HTP connection.\nAnd what is that? Oh, uh, you are aware that like HTP traffic used to be gzipped, but broley is the more modern compression algorithm rather than gzipped. So browsers send a pretty standard exception coding set. So it’s a sort of hierarchical set of encodings that accept, and I think it’s now basically the same across all browsers.\nAnd it has broadly as the top. Most recommended compression algorithm, which is [00:05:00] therefore presumably what most servers support as well. Gotcha. And when you compress like a file with a bunch of spaces in it, you make it a lot smaller in these compression algorithms. Mm. It’s never gonna be as good. This is the thing, it depends how obsessed you are with performance because while all these things have definitely made it a lot better, if you really obsess over it and you totally minify your JavaScript so that it replaces your variable names with single character ones and everything, that is always gonna be a little bit smaller.\nAnd if you like bundle up your JavaScript and you put it in exactly the right place in the HTML so that it requests it at just the right moment or whatever, if you really obsess over it, you’re definitely going to squeeze more. Performance out of it, but it might well be, and maybe this is what DHH was saying, that we’ve got to a point where it really doesn’t matter anymore.\nYou don’t need to do that because the baseline way that it handles it is good enough. I believe so.\nTris: Well, that’s my takeaway from the video is that we used to bundle all of our, say JavaScript into a single file and then minify it and then send it across the line. But you get so close to the same level of compression by doing nothing today.\nSo just don’t do anything and what you will get for your payment of a very slight increase in bundle size, or rather in request response size, is you will get the old internet back and unlocked. You will allow the people viewing your website. To kind of poke around and see what you were doing and learn what you were doing and say, oh, this is very cool.\nI like what they’re doing here. Lemme just look at the source code here. Open up the inspector, see what’s going on. And it’s not garbage. Minified. Yeah. Challenging to, to, to use. It’s the old. Internet, which is how you and I, I suspect how we learned HTML, JavaScript and CSS by pulling apart the source code of websites that we were seeing and going, oh, what are they doing here?\nLemme have a little look here. That’s certainly how I learned front end. How about you?\nRobin: Yeah, no, I completely agree. Like for me, becoming a web developer, it was so magical. To discover that it was all just H TM L text and these other things, right, that you could very easily understand. You could very easily imagine that you could just open up in Notepad and write your own version and then send, send it to a browser and it would display as this magical website.\nAnd I just absolutely loved it. It’s interesting. I didn’t think that was what you were going to mean by the old internet, because the other interpretation of the old internet would be sort of like internet one, right? Like before, before everything was dynamic. Glitzy single page application.\nMm.\nWhich is a bit related, but it’s not quite the same point.\nYes, you are. You are talking about the internet that is inspectable, like readable. It’s all the same. Yeah,\nTris: it’s all the same. I wanted to get on onto that for sure. Mm. I I was hoping that maybe you and I could brainstorm what we mean by the old internet and I’ll start immediately, like the best kind of the web today with today’s technology.\nKeeping all of the good things that we’ve lost because the whole internet at the moment is five websites with screenshots of the other four. What have we lost,\nRobin: stolen installment from Cory Doc, I think.\nTris: Is that Cory Doc? Oh my God. Ah, that’s so good. Such a good turn of Frank. Yeah. But like things like URLs actually working instead of a web app, that the URL never changes and it’s just like this dynamic single page thing that never moves around.\nLike URLs are great. I love URLs. You love URLs? Yeah. URLs are fantastic. Absolutely. They give us, as consumers of the website so much power.\nRobin: Yeah. And this is what Obsidian is trying to be built around. I love. Like writing, since I arrived at my new company, I’ve written there’s probably more documentation than than anyone there has ever written before.\nUm, and as I do it, I’m like adding links all over the place. And this is also what I do when I’m like reviewing pull requests, right? I’ll describe in quite minute detail why I think a different structure for this class would be better. And then I’ll link over to a Wikipedia article about a particular concept.\nAnd I think just. Enriching the meaning of what you are writing with a link off to another place that has other information. It’s just so cool and it’s the thing that the web fundamentally gave us that you never had before. But before we move on from it, I do really want to say that this thing that you are saying about the fact that there’s a value to just being able to open your JavaScript and just be able to read it exactly as it was written, is something that I have cared about deeply.\nI’ve so struggled to find anybody around me in web development teams that also cares about it, right? Like it’s the fundamental open source ness of the internet, isn’t it? It’s that anybody can just open it. You can go view source, and it will make sense to you if you just get past the fact that there’s some weird angle brackets here and there.\nYeah.\nAnd it’ll make sense to you unless somebody’s gone and done the stupid thing of like making it all into a one line document with like, yes. You know? Like, yeah,\nTris: as you say, it’s naturally open source. If I’ve got an app on my phone, it’s completely opaque to me. Like I can use it, but it’s just this blob of application and even a developer cannot.\nOr like a security researcher, like [00:10:00] someone who has the best knowledge of like disassembly and how to get into the internals of these things just can’t really give you much. You can like pull out some strings, pull out a bit of information, but nothing really, and that’s all by design. Whereas the web is view source by design.\nYeah. Which is just gorgeous.\nRobin: Yeah. I think I particularly remember getting into arguments about this when people were raving about web assembly. And I was saying. It’s great in all. Mm-hmm. But a big downside is the fact that it’s hiding away from you. A binary.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: Right. And you can’t, you can no longer tell how a thing is written or what’s going on.\nYes.\nTris: Yeah. Uh, probably you were talking to me because I would’ve been talking about rust and web assembly and how it’s fantastic, but you sure can’t view source. You have to rely on the social contract of open source software where you present. The user with a binary, and you also say, here is the source code for this binary you’re looking at.\nIt’s not as tight as just, Hey, here’s the source. Yeah, your browser will run this.\nRobin: I was just trying to find these websites. It seemed to have disappeared. But the other thing that you could mean by the old internet is, so there’s this concept called the lean web. Which doesn’t seem to exist as much as it used to, or I just can’t find it.\nAnd then our role, Balkan,\nmm-hmm.\nCoined this phrase Web Zero, which sort of means the same thing ish. It’s all this point that single page applications are over engineered. They obscure everything away from you. They try and. Reimplement things that Browse already does. Yes. Uh, and now suddenly every webpage is like 10 megabytes and it’s using up everyone’s bandwidth and it makes everything slower.\nAnd you need all this CPU to be able to run all the complicated JavaScript frameworks. Mm-hmm. And it’s also related to, Corey talks about this very powerfully, he calls it the surveillance lag. Mm-hmm. Every time you load a webpage, it then has to like. Load all the ad tracking stuff before it can do anything useful.\nAh, and then he describes it as, what am I bid for? You know, one Tris Osen and he goes and does it. But yeah, like fundamentally, because we have this surveillance capitalism world, it means that every web developer now has to include all of these tools. So the first thing talking about Web Zero, ’cause I’ve always tried to write my website as simply as possible.\nAnd if you go and look at it, hopefully you’ll see that it’s as simple as possible and the big. Decision that was difficult to make, but once I made it, I felt a lot lighter was not to include Google Analytics or any equivalent client side analytics tracker.\nMm-hmm.\nBecause you should, in theory, be able to track that purely based on server side logs, right?\nYou don’t need Yes, exactly. You shouldn’t need to be hijacking the reader’s computer. To make them do extra compute and send off extra requests to random websites so that you can see that they saw your page.\nTris: No, indeed, and it’s not just random websites, it’s 98% of the internet is sending telemetry tracking data to Google.\nMm. That’s the real problem, technically a problem for the users of the website that you are causing them to be a little bit slow. That’s the technical problem. The moral problem is participating in global surveillance.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: Horrifying. When I worked at the UK Government Digital Service, we had to upgrade from an old version of Google Analytics to a new version of Google Analytics on some site, and I was like setting my desk on fire virtually to say, how about we don’t, how about we upgrade to nothing?\nHow about we upgrade to not opting in to Google surveillance of the population of the United Kingdom when they’re trying to just like find out some tax law or some benefits laws or like whatever. Like it’s just seemed unbelievably immoral to me. And even then in an environment with really smart people who care about privacy, I was not able to do it.\nYeah. That, because the answer is Google have a monopoly on analytics, and if you want analytics, you have to use Google, and no one else is even in the game really.\nRobin: But what they’re actually doing isn’t very complicated. It’s not like one of these other things where there’s some kind of monopoly of scale or network effects where actually you could send your analytics anywhere and you’d still get a nice graph that tells you what you want to know, right?\nLike there’s nothing particularly special. The only thing about Google Analytics is that it’s free.\nTris: Agree, there is something you’re missing every. Analytics platform and third party service has an integration with Google Analytics and assumes it’s the default, doesn’t have any integration with your weird analytics that you’ve just built.\nIt’s all Google Analytics focused and the analyst, like somebody who is like specialist in this, feels that they are trained. To be an expert in Google Analytics. I’ve never found an expert in Google\nRobin: Analytics in my whole career.\nTris: [00:15:00] I delicately agree with you. I believe, I use the expression feels that they are yes, an expert like change.\nSo changing that fundamentally changes their job they feel. Um, on encapsulate.com, perhaps you do the same on your site. Robin winslow.uk. We use CloudFlare and we use CloudFlare logs, which are entirely server side. Or rather, they’re not on the client’s machine. They’re all the, the DNS level and I, they don’t give you such rich analytics as Google does.\nLike how many times did they use a mouse over this or give a heat map of where they were clicking and looking firstly, that’s gross. Secondly, no one is ever, in my experience of people do using their software, giving me anything useful to do with that. Do you get 99% of the way there with. What pages are users going to?\nRobin: This could take us in a tangential direction, which could be a future topic perhaps, which is about just the. The tendency to just collect data for the sake of it, right? Mm-hmm. The theory is that you will look at the heat map data and you will use it to understand your users better, so you know that they’re scrolling this far down the page, they’re seeing this thing over here, and maybe some of the time it does get used for that usefully in some kind of way.\nBut really what they’re trying to replace is like a good old fashioned user study where you actually deliberately go and observe your users using your website and note down what it is they get up to. Yeah. And those are really valuable, I believe, in usability research. I think it’s a very good thing, certainly, but I think this is a very poor man’s shadow version of it, and I think it tends not to lead to very good optimizations, but people collect the data in case it can help and there’s so much.\nThat gets collected in that way, but I’m not gonna go too far down that track. It’s absolutely, it’s a diversion.\nTris: I’ll bring us back. I’ll bring us back to the original topic by saying that you don’t find the needles easier by making the haystack bigger. Yeah. And that’s what these tools do. Yeah. It’s incredible.\nBack to Web Zero, was it, you said? Although the old internet? Yeah. The reason I’m bringing this up is that I have a draft video. Called Welcome back to the internet. It’s my current draft. After speaking with you today. I might call it view source, but I think maybe the first one is good for that, or maybe the thumbnail can just be a stylized view source.\nThat could be, that could be quite good. Yeah. I like both. Yes, I’ve noted them down and thank you, but there’s such a movement at the moment. In fact, the movement has gone so far as to there. There are some people who say, we need to forget the current web. Let’s make a new one. You might have heard of the Gemini Project, which is based on Gopher, or inspired by Gopher, which is just, you can think of it as a markdown browser, so really restricted syntax, just like seven things, bold, italic headings.\nLists and numbered lists, that sort of thing. And a text a, a fairly plain text browser and it’s got links and it’s got embedded images and that’s it. That’s your lot. No CSS, which the creators perceive as being unnecessary Complexity, certainly no JavaScript, which we all might agree is often unnecessary complexity, but I think that actually goes too far.\nI think that belies a misunderstanding that we don’t have to throw away all of the web. To get back to the old web. There are communities like neo cities.org who are bringing back the old web. It sounds like. I hear you laughing. It sounds like you know neo cities.\nRobin: Yeah, I mean like Neo cities is obviously a nostalgia project.\nCertainly. Which I think is, it’s nice, but it’s not where we’re going ’cause it’s where we’ve been and whatever comes in the future is gonna look a bit different. But I completely agree with you that I certainly hope that there’s a significant appetite for just rejecting all of the. Glitzy bullshit, pr, marketing, fanciness of these modern websites that are actually like stealing all your bandwidth and your CPU time and tracking you, surveilling you and trying to manipulate you, stealing your attention and all this kind of stuff.\nAnd I think everybody will relate to that message on some level. You know, you sit down on the sofa, you wake up an hour and a half later and you are like. Why did I just start doom scrolling? I didn’t want to. So I think that some level, there really is a huge movement of people that are really frustrated with this system.\nTris: Yeah, I think the message that I, I hope to give over with this video, welcome back to the internet, is that all of the, the good parts. It didn’t go away. They weren’t replaced. We just chose to use Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and IT and the app ecosystem. Now you might say that we were guided there by the delicate hand of Google and Apple who encourage this sort of closed, yeah, this closed approach.\nHowever, the old internet is still there. Email. Is still available. Websites, blogs, messaging apps [00:20:00] such as Telegram that use a real API and don’t clock you in. And you can use third party apps. You can make a watch app like it’s just as Wild West as it was in the nineties. And even Firefox for the moment is still here.\nYou don’t have to buy into. Google’s domination of the front end of this, all of the browser. And as we discovered, they have recently enacted their 15 year plan, which is disabling the ability to install an ad blocker because they now feel that they are so. Well secure in their domination of the landscape.\nThey’re so sure of themselves. Mm. You can just download new browser. It’s not legal. You can just have Firefox. I\nRobin: fear that’s kind of true though, that they have won the domination. Like if we are really serious about this. Right. Okay. So I was aware in let’s say 2010 uhhuh, that there was a battle going on.\nWhere mobile operating systems were trying to come in and replace the internet as the fundamental place for application development. Mm-hmm. And that this was the risk is that it it, it was a power grab by the companies that control my mobile phone operating systems. And at the time, I think I was probably young and naive enough to reassure myself that they weren’t gonna win for this reason or that reason, but I think they did win.\nIf you think of it from the perspective of a mobile phone, right? We know that mobile devices are what most people use across the world.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd on a mobile device, just think about the experience of using most web products versus an app. Mm-hmm. And it’s like, it’s been so impoverished, the web experience.\nThat you’d kind of be crazy to expect that somebody would prefer to use webpages over a native app at this point. I feel\nTris: that is true, and we must fight to get away from it. Yeah, but the way is very clear. I run Firefox on my phone, quite a lot of the web apps that I use, sorry. Quite a lot of the mobile apps that are running on my phone are actually just a skinned browser.\nThey’re just electro. I know.\nRobin: I know.\nTris: And so actually there’s no resistance. To getting a web version of that app because we actually, it’s just written, but\nRobin: it’s just, the thing is that because they run the os, they’ve got the ability to make things so annoying for you. So for example, right. There really is nothing better about the YouTube app than about YouTube through Firefox.\n’cause I also run Firefox on my, on my phone. And in fact there are massive benefits to running YouTube on Firefi. You subscribe to YouTube, so you probably don’t experience this pain. I don’t subscribe to YouTube. I\nTris: do not subscribe to\nRobin: YouTube. Oh you don’t? Oh, okay. I get adverts. Okay, cool. Well then you are, um, yeah, if you run it in Firefox, you can swipe away Firefox and then you can swipe down from the top and you can press play in your little, you know, the little kind of like media is playing box that appears on your notifications.\nAnd then it will play in the background. And not only will it play in the background, it now won’t include adverts.\nTris: Yes, I did know that. Yeah, you can just play it in Firefox, hit the home screen and it plays in the background mark. Right.\nRobin: But still, it’s a really annoying experience. I’ll be in the YouTube app.\nI’ll try and open a video and I will say open in Firefox and it will open Firefox and it’ll switch right back to YouTube because Firefox will remember that it’s supposed to use the YouTube app. There’s just so many 10 drills that try to push you and force you into the native app experience that it just feels like it’s so hard to.\nPersuade people to do anything else, you know?\nTris: Yes. But not impossible. Yeah. Yeah. I was there as I’m, as I believe you were in 2004 when Firefox 1.0 came out. And everyone who downloaded, maybe on the first day or in the first week or before it hit a million downloads or something like that, got a, uh, novelty PDF certificate that said, thank you for making Firefox possible, or something like that.\nAnd I still have that PDFI should print it out and display it proudly.\nRobin: You should, yeah. Make a poster out of it.\nTris: I’m telling you this because we have been here before. You and I, and many of our listeners grew up in the absolute domination of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, which is now a punchline and a joke and an afterthought.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: We are in a better place at the moment than we were then because Firefox already exists, so I believe we can get back there. The cycle of the wheel of history can keep turning.\nRobin: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I, I think particularly with ai, there will come a point at least where the new generation completely rejects.\nThat whole bloated mess in some way. Oh yeah. And and it will look like the pieces that are like of the old stuff probably. And they’ll build a whole new movement out of it. And I’m done. I’m totally there for it. I guess I’m a bit jaded at this point.\nTris: Yeah. I mean, it sounds like you should go work for Ruby on Rails or 37 Signals or something that [00:25:00] sounds like it’ll be a perfect match for you.\nThe subtitle of the video of DHHS Rails World Video to bring it all back home Yeah. Is it’s fun to be competent. And that comes from a halfway through the video where DHH said, when you are building real JavaScript instead of JavaScript, which is maybe in a different framework that makes things different, not better or worse, just different.\nAnd when you are writing real CSS, not some pre-processing framework, and when you’re writing real HTML, not some component framework or I’m not sure if he mentioned utility CSS, um. Like tailwind, but it was definitely hinting at it. Instead of learning all of those frameworks, you can just learn HTML, JavaScript and CSS because it’s fun.\nTo be competent. It’s fun to actually do it yourself. Yeah. If you are a backend developer, it’s fun to learn a bit of JavaScript ’cause it’s not the nineties JavaScript’s great. And more importantly, the browser is really great.\nRobin: Yeah, I think, I mean, what you’re kind of hinting at there is, I’m talking about the social problem of the fact that these, these monopolies have won, they control the population basically at this point.\nWhat I hear in your response is we need to win back the hearts and minds of the people who are building the tools. I think that’s exactly right. That’s the way to do it. You remember that being a web developer in the two thousands was inspiring, right? And in a way that that has just gone, nobody is now proud to be working for Google or working for Meta, or working for like, they’re just not.\nNo. And that’s got a huge opportunity in it, I hope. I hope so too.\nUnit Testing and Calcified Codebases\nRobin: I’ve been a little bit obsessing about this testing thing ’cause it’s come up a couple of times at work. I think that the development community has gone through a significant evolution when it comes to testing code bases, uhhuh. The original version of testing that is very useful for a technical system is functional testing where you define your functional requirements.\nAnd then you make sure your requirements are met. That could be done completely manually. You’ve written down a document where you say it needs to do this, and then you have somebody click through the system and just say, yeah, it does that,\nTris: right? You might even find in a, like a government contract, you might have acceptance criteria for the contract.\nRobin: Right. Exactly. Exactly. So then unit testing is a very old term, and it started right back at the beginning of software development. I mean, apparently the first recorded usage of it is in 1956. It was in the US Navy’s Symposium on advanced programming methods for digital computers. That’s it. Then the SAGE Project and the Mercury Project.\nThis was at the point of program development where we’re still like using punch cards and things like that. It was a revolution where you were starting to build. A system that might actually make use of pieces that might have been written in a couple of different teams. We can have a test that will make sure the thing that team is providing actually definitely works before we use it in this other system.\nSo unit in its original meaning had this enabling modularity philosophy behind it. Right now it’s my feeling that that’s not what people understand unit testing to mean anymore. The TDD movement became a cudgel to beat people with. There are a lot of code bases around that have been weighed down by the tests.\nChanging anything will break everything all over the place. If I move this hair over to the left two centimeters, then the whole thing’s gonna collapse, so I’m not gonna do it. We agree that what I believe is the spirit of the original meaning of the term unit test. We should be testing at the interface.\nMm-hmm. If you write a system, you want it to have tests that are checking, that the actual promises are met. A simple version would be testing an API, but API has a very clearly written API specification that says you can make a post request over here. It has these parameters, you’ll get this in response.\nThese are the status codes you can expect back, et cetera. Right. And that is then something that’s very, very easy to test and the best version. Of a fully tested code base would be an API, where you’ve written tests that cover every single one of these specified endpoints that you’re supposed to be delivering and make sure that they all pass.\nSo one reason why you might want a tune test at a lower level would be because there’s an internal module. So for example, you might have a model layer that transforms model objects into database reads and database rights. At that point, you might say, we’re gonna formally define its interface to say it provides these different model classes, and they all have these different.\nActions you can take on them. Once you’ve then formalized that, now you can write tests around that which make sure that that model layer absolutely works right. The thing that frustrates me over and over again is I see people writing tests very deep in the application, so they’re using a whole load of internal.\nPrivate stuff. Yeah, private stuff. And every single little function is coupled to another test. So I think two software engineers this shift in thinking would make a huge difference. Now, I [00:30:00] originally brought this topic to you mm-hmm. As a sort of criticism of test driven development, and we got into a little bit of a back and forth.\nYeah. Because you’ve had a very good experience with test of development and you, I sure have, think that your version of test of development is not incompatible with what I’m saying. Is that right?\nTris: Yes, absolutely. Yeah. The testing of the interface, the tests that run on CI and run on the server, like the tests that you share with your colleagues are very different to the tests that you write throughout your use of TDD in your discipline of writing code.\nA lot of the tests that you write as part of your. Red green refactor cycle. As you zoom in and hone in on the exact functionality that you intend to change, you intend to write. A lot of those are transient artifacts. They’re almost like compiled artifacts that are on your machine. They’re not, you’re not gonna commit them back up.\nNo. No one else cares about those. They helped you do your job, and when they’re done, you discard them. They are not necessarily. At the level of the interface, which would be a good test to, a good unit test to check in. They are whatever level that makes sense to you. Maybe as you said, those coders that you’ve experienced, like coding way too low level or inside the private interfaces of modules or whatever, those are actually perfectly fine for TDD or they can be perfectly fine for TDD, but you don’t check them in\nRobin: if you are gonna stop.\nWith that attitude then wouldn’t a reasonable next step be to say, since I’ve written this test that tests this internal object that doesn’t matter to the external interface of this thing, why wouldn’t I check it in? Because what happens when I then want to evolve it later and I already have a test that could help me to do it?\nTris: Like the high level test should actually be testing what you’re actually trying to do. If you are not there yet, you can kind of get there.\nRobin: Yeah. What I thought you were gonna say about TDD was that you transformed the test. So you’ll start by writing the smallest part of your solution, right? You’ll write a little bit of code and it will fail.\nThen you go and you change it a bit and it’ll pass, and you go back and you change your test and it’ll fail. And through the process of changing the test, you eventually end up at the. Interface test, but I think that’s not what you just said, so maybe you don’t think that that would happen.\nTris: I’m not sure if there are exactly hard and fast rules, and I think that in terms of like choosing the correct level of obstruction for your unit tests, it’s extremely tied to experience.\nWhat you described as getting frustrated that there were a lot of unnecessary tests down at the low level. It seems to me the difference between a senior or lead developer who has an understanding of like the whole system versus a junior or me or a lower experienced developer who is coming at it from the bottom up.\nHere’s a function. And then this function calls another function. They’ve got to like navigate their way up the abstraction layers, whereas someone who is more experienced sees the whole thing and sees, oh, well this is where you should put your tests very obviously. Whereas if you’re in the weeds, if you’re down in the if foundations of the program in the functions, then.\nYou might not choose the right level due to experience.\nRobin: Okay, so there’s two things that I want to focus on there. One is I don’t know that this is a junior, senior problem per se. I’ve definitely had lots of poor requests from experienced developers who are testing things that are far lower level than I think they should be.\nI think that it is a thing that you see juniors do more. But I think the reason you see juniors do it more is because it’s what they were taught, and then you only get the confidence to challenge the status quo when you’re a bit more senior. That would be the only way that I’d say it. It has a junior, senior cadence, because I would say that overall everybody, a junior or senior developer should ideally be handed a user story, right?\nThey should ideally be handed a thing to solve that tells you what you are actually trying to change on the behavior of the whole system. The first thing to do is to say, what test would I then write? The test you would write is the thing that tests that the system has changed. I don’t think that it’s nuanced.\nI don’t think that it’s a thing that you can only learn with experience. I think it, it is sometimes difficult to hold the two perspectives in your head. You’re changing something in a small function and the actual effect is this outside effect. I don’t think choosing the level at which to do your test is nuanced.\nI think it is quite clear whether you’re testing from the interface level or you’re testing beneath it personally. And I think, and I think if you think it’s nuanced, then you might be not. Basically following the maxim that I’m trying to suggest that people should be following to make sure that the thing [00:35:00] is well tested and efficiently tested.\nRight. Do you see what I mean? Mm-hmm. ’cause I think the outside is obvious. Like with any, what is the maxim? Can you state it? Oh, tests from the interface, right? Interface tests. Well, I would’ve called it, right? Interface tests. Don’t write unit tests because I think what unit tests have now become. Is this sort of low level test, but that’s not very clear because I think the actual definition of unit test is more fuzzy.\nBut it would be write tests at the interface and only write ’em against something that can be said to be a formal interface. I like it. You should write the book. I buy it. Oh, good. Good. Oh, well I’m glad you agree with it. I suppose if I was a little braver, I might press a bit harder on its compatibility with TDD, but I know that we had a, you know, I mean, do you really throw away, um,\nTris: what’s the refactor part of red green refactor?\nYou are, you are refactoring your tests. You are refactoring your code, and so you’re not like deleting files. You are just evolving them and evolving them, and evolving them, and eventually your code is written up to the interface and the test is written up to the interface.\nRobin: Oh, so you are saying it eventually transforms into an interface test\nTris: It Can I, I’m not.\nSaying so, so strongly, right. I’m not sure if that is a, if that is a rule.\nRobin: The thing, well, I certainly am familiar with the fact that in every piece of development I would be trying out stuff. I would be checking it in the ways that I want to check it, and then the process I’ve gone through to do that.\nVery often bears only a vague resemblance to the PRI eventually submit. Right. That’s pretty common. Hmm. So I think that’s sort of what you’re saying is that you’re using, you’re using a test first approach as your discipline for creating the solution, and then there will always be a bit of a recrafting when you decide what you’re actually trying to propose into the central code base.\nTris: Yeah, absolutely. Like you might refactor your code to make it up to the standards that your team expects and uses, and you would do the same for your test.\nRobin: Yeah, you push it up, the test fail, and then you’re like, oh, I gotta run format, and then you Right. Happens so often. I’m glad that you agree with all that.\nI think maybe you don’t agree with me on the problem. I see this as a quite significant problem that I can run into every day. Do you think it’s a problem? Do you understand why? I think it’s important to focus on it? Yes.\nTris: Slowing down speed of development. Yeah, there’s a, yeah, the code coverage fixation.\nOf dynamic languages has a lot to answer for, I think.\nRobin: Yeah. But you can very easily achieve a hundred percent code coverage testing from the outside. Like I don’t think it, it precludes the idea of having a hundred percent code coverage at all.\nTris: It’s not as easy than doing it with unit tests or you doing it with bottom up tests.\nIf you’ve got five lines in a branch of a if statement that are own, that aren’t covered, it’s a lot easier to like to say,\nRobin: what function are those lines in? Yeah. And then you test the function. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nTris: It’s cheating. But it’s yes. You know, show me how, you, tell me how you measure me and I will tell you how I will behave.\nThat’s what we’re talking about here.\nRobin: Yes. Yeah, exactly. I suppose I just feel that if you could be disciplined about doing it the way I’m suggesting, that’s actually far more valuable. If you discover that you haven’t tested 5% of your application, you now have to figure out why your interface tests haven’t tested that 5%, right?\nAnd then in that process, you might decide that 5% should be just discarded. You know what I mean? Absolutely. And that’s a really good thing.\nTris: It certainly is.\nRobin: I suppose I feel that in enterprises. There are many, many code bases that just grind to a halt. They get old, they get crusty. No one knows how to run them.\nEverybody’s scared of breaking them. And then they just become this drain, this tech debt, this really complex piece. There’s like a feature request list as long as your arm, and no one’s paying attention to any of them because no one can actually work on the thing. Right? And that’s, I think, what I’m worried about, this death of code projects.\nAnd you need to keep it vibrant. You need to keep it active. And the way you do that is by keeping your tests away from. Stopping you from innovating and stopping you from changing your code. You do that by only testing the bit. You need a test, which is the actual function of the thing.\nTris: Uh, yeah, I couldn’t agree more.\nThis is why I love rust, because there’s so little to test in rust, because the code is the test for 99% of the cases that you would otherwise have to write a unit test for in a language, say like Python or JavaScript, like you don’t. Like every single rust project, the code coverage is 100%. Like it’s a compiled language.\nThere are no deadlines, there are no lines of syntax that aren’t correct. But because rusts syntax encode so much valuable information, not only do those lines compile the meaning behind them, compiles, uh, and is valid. So like I only care about interface testing at the highest level. Rust. There’s no point doing one of those classic.\nThe test basically rewrites the function and you get this one-to-one equivalence of lines of code because the compiler’s already doing that. You don’t need to worry about that. Oh, right. It’s marvelous.\nRobin: Do [00:40:00] you think that rust teams, they not. Subservient to this a hundred percent code coverage maxim, or do they do it all through the interface?\nI see so often these tests where the test is almost just a duplicate of the code that’s in the function and it’s ridiculous. And if you were to write a test for rust, it sounds like you’re basically saying you’d be doing that. You would be saying, does the code do exactly what the code does? And yet I can imagine that there would be people who would write those tests\nTris: perhaps, but you don’t have to be quite as nervous.\nWhen you’re writing in rust or indeed any compiled language, but rust takes this to an extreme. Yeah.\nRobin: But you see, to me, it’s the dogma. I feel like there’s a significant dogma around saying, if you are a professional engineer, you must be writing these tests. And I’m just curious whether you think that exists at all in Rust or whether you think it, it just doesn’t, like they’re just free from the pressure to write tests in that way.\nTris: I think it is overwhelmingly the latter that you are freed from the need to write ridiculous tests because the, okay, the compiler contract with the rich type system. Has already covered a lot of these things I’ve said before in in videos, and I believe I’ve spoken to you about it, that because Rust has the lifetime annotation system, you can describe not just what your data is, but when, which is wildly powerful.\nAnd it was built into the language so that you could describe when the data is valid so that the memory can be freed when it falls outta scope. Great. And just accidentally made this. Amazing feature that people like me who kind of don’t care about low level stuff like memory, can hijack it to make type safe rules such as an order is only valid if the.\nCustomer remains valid. You can temporarily link your types like this. Mm. I would’ve had to write a unit test to test that relationship before. I’ve had to write it into four loops and if statements in the code, and then I would’ve had to write tests that involve four loops and if statements. But now I’ve got this rich type hierarchy where I can guarantee everything at the compile time.\nIt’s fricking amazing. There is no faster test than a test that is unwritten. When I hit save in my IDE, the compiler compiles, and we’re done.\nRobin: That explains why I feel this is very important and you, that you don’t seem like this is really important. And that’s clearly because you know the world you are in is simply more evolved.\nSo I’m, I’m wrestling with issues that exist in the old world before people have created these superior supply systems. I mean, you, you are correct.\nThe dangers of being a YouTuber\nTris: I’ve been meaning to open up some sort of scholarship mentoring option for. Years now. Mm. Like ever since I first started the mentoring and like within the first month or two I realized, oh no, because I’m charging so much, I’m only getting people who are very rich and who already have the means to get private mentoring.\nYeah. And this probably happens with tutors all over the world. Yes. Forever. Like the people who can afford your services are the people that can afford it. Yeah. People that really need your services will never come to you because they can’t afford it.\nRobin: Yes. I suppose, um, maybe the quintessential example is pro bono lawyers, right?\nLike as in lawyers are a fantastically expensive resource who are mostly only available to the most rich and powerful people. And then that’s why it’s kind of a well-known thing that lawyers will often do pro bono work, right? Which is where they work for free for, for people that need lawyer lawyering services.\nRight? It’s a good example. I would be very nervous about choosing to become. Particularly a YouTuber because I’m so aware that you would be at the whims of the YouTube algorithm.\nMm.\nAnd that Google nowhere near has your interests at heart. Yes. Um, and, and it will cast you aside in a moment. It just doesn’t care.\nYes. And, and, and, and you are completely at the mercy of Google’s decisions. And you have done a very good job of extracting yourself from that sort of liability by having your mentoring and having your Patreon. And I’m curious, right? I suppose my feeling was that you had started this journey, you quit your job, and then.\nIt was my impression, and you might tell me this is wrong, but it was my impression that sort of your income over the next month or two might have been about 10 or 15% less than you might have hoped, and I got the impression you were then working quite hard because you felt a little bit of that pressure.\nAnd like you said, you got RSI, you got burnout. And, and, and so I was also genuinely curious in like how comfortable you feel at this present time. ’cause I don’t think I’ve, I’ve quite had, I, I don’t think I know very clearly how, how you feel now,\nTris: right? I didn’t quit my job until I was able to get enough non YouTube income, Patreon income [00:45:00] to support my bills and food.\nBecause I wanted to be able to say, get COVID and be off, you know, not make any videos for a month or two.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: And not for that to be a catastrophe.\nRobin: Yeah. And,\nTris: and patrons like, it, it, it feels like I have a salary rather than that I have to a gig work. Yeah. Um, which is wonderful and I wish for anyone who is interested in the creator universe.\nThat’s, that, that’s marvelous. Yeah. What unlocked it for me is this the, the mentoring peers that I, that I, that I do on my, my Patreon. Yeah. That is so much money that only, yeah. Successful people were able to do it. But now, and it’s a\nRobin: subscription model. It’s not, it’s not one time mentoring. It, it, it’s like they pay this every month, they get one session every month.\nTris: Yes. That’s it. You can, you can just cancel after the first session. And people are very welcome to do that. A few people have mm-hmm. I’ve been able to answer all the questions like, we’ve blasted through it and it’s been fine. Um, but most people want like an ongoing. Relationship. No students were signing up for 250 bucks a month.\nOf course, that’s too expensive. Yes. So, so last month I was finding in the position where I could offer this concession mentoring. And so I, so for a fifth of the price, $50, I opened up just 10 slots. That’s all I could spare for my calendar. 10 slots of these, uh, scholarship mentoring is what I’m calling it for, um, students, women, and non-binary.\nUm, minoritized people and a, a few other categories like people who are underrepresented in both like the tech world and my students. Like, how can I fix that? I’ve got this very, very, this very, uh. Blunt lever, which is cost. That’s the only lever that I can change to, to, to help that. And I’ve always wanted to, like, I get emails from students all the time asking for like, if I can do, if I can do this, and I now say, I now finally can say yes.\nI always, in the past, I’ve always liked, helped people who, who, who reach out. I’m only human, but I can’t like give the time that I want because I have to. Do things that make money because of the terrible world we live in.\nRobin: Yeah. So I really like the scholarship thing. Appreciate it. But I really like the, uh, the concept and the challenge of trying to do it.\nAnd I so sort of do, I, I sort of wish I had your problem in the sense that like, well, on one level, I, I would definitely love to be making content like you do and, and, and have that be. The thing that I do that people care about. Mm-hmm. To be a thought leader, you know? Sure. That’s a be, that’s a better name than influencer, isn’t it?\nAlthough it basically means the same thing. It is.\nTris: It tri, it triggers me a lot because I once had a very nice manager who was very switched on and he very delicately after my first. Review. So Tris, you’ve, you’re, you’ve become a, a real thought leader in our team, and I’d like you to become an action leader.\nAnd that was his way of saying, do some bloody work.\nRobin: Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, that’s, no, that’s horrible. That is, that is, oh my God. Oh.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/4/","title":"Rediscovering the Old Internet, Rethinking Unit Testing, and Navigating the Creator Economy"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/5/":{"body":"\n\nTris despairs at Robin’s desk setup, Robin recommends tech/lefty podcasts, and Tris explains how he’s augmenting his Obsidian use with the open-source ecosystem.\n\n📖 CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 Intros, summer over\n01:14 Robin’s home working environment\n31:53 Robin’s leftist podcast recs\n52:25 Tris’s non-fiction podcast recs\n54:47 Demo to Robin how Tris makes his videos\n\n🔗 LINKS\n\nROBIN’S SHAMEFUL DINING TABLE SETUP:\n\n\nOurs\n\nhttps://robinwinslow.uk\nhttps://noboilerplate.org\nhttps://lostterminal.com\nhttps://modemprometheus.com\nhttps://phosphenecatalogue.com\n\nExternal\n\nScott Hanselman’s “Brain, Back, Buns, and Bites” article\nPresenterm\n\nRobin’s podcast list\n\nThe Intercept\nDrop Site News\nMacro Dose\nDeconstructed\nPolitics Theory Other\nFactually with Adam Conover\nOn the Media\nTech Policy Press\nTech Dirt\nEach Week Work Repeat\n\nTris’s podcast list\n\nSelf-Directed Research\nWB-40\nCortex\n\n🧑 CREDITS\nDecapsulate is a NAMTAO Production (namtao.com)\nIt is hosted by:\n\nTristram Oaten (https://mastodon.social/@0atman)\nRobin Winslow (https://union.place/@nottrobin)\n\nThis work is BrainMade (https://brainmade.org)\nTranscript\nIntros, summer over\nTris: Right. There we go. September, I can’t believe it. Where’s the summer gone or where’s the summer going?\nRobin: mean, it’s crazy to be, for me, obviously it, it’s, it means kids starting school.\nTris: Of course. Right. That’s exciting.\nRobin: the school holiday, summer, even if people don’t have kids, I feel like everything is oriented around school holiday, you know, in terms of what events are happening and all that\nOrganising life around academic year\nTris: Right, exactly. Yes. my heroes seem to be great organizes this year around the academic year, and I think that like ending with the summer is quite a nice, like, reset quite a nice big block of time. Although you could argue that winter also works quite well, but we we’re no longer in the Roman Empire where everything stops for four months for an enormous single month cold winter.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: so school holidays, my upcoming video, the video is called Obsidian for Students. I’ve timed it for back to school.\nRobin: Oh, wow.\nprofessional.\nMental health day\nTris: I mean, I’m trying, everyone says you’ve gotta like, get in all this and every single year I miss Mental Health Day. even though all of my podcasts and half of my videos are about mental health. Um, right.\nRobin: some strong\nTris: Uh,\nRobin: don’t you, for the lead up to that.\nRobin’s home working environment\nTris: yes, exactly. So we were gonna talk about some other stuff, but I have sneaked in an extra extra topic because you mentioned just now that you were interested in setting up a new workspace in your new house.\nRobin: Yes,\nTris: opinions. Tell me.\nRobin: Yeah. So I, sent you the photo of what my setup right now looks like, which is just that I moved into this house,\nTris: Oh.\nRobin: was full of. Furniture because it’s, um, you know, furnished place. It used to be an Airbnb, so it was like really kitted out and I’ve already shipped out a couple of beds into a storage place.\nand I just haven’t gone around to like, getting rid of this table because if I get rid of this table right now, I have nothing else to work on. But ul ultimately I think I want this room to be to be like a massive play place for the kids when I’m not working. So I kind of want a desk that is a work desk. Like I think I’ve given up on the idea of having an actual dining table in this room, which is what this table\nTris: Yeah. Gotcha.\nRobin: so I want a desk that is a work desk that I can kind of put away behind the, the door or something quite easily, um, if I need to. but otherwise, when it comes out, it’s like a proper workstation and I’ve got a proper chair a little bit of an A DHD thing. It’s\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: of the life I had I got very used to just working ad hoc wherever, so I never\nTris: Oh,\nRobin: a place to work, and now I’m\nTris: right. That’s where everyone starts.\nRobin: improve that. So I, I have very little experience in this and I wanna do it.\nTris: I must tell the listener. What I am seeing here, because this photo is, it looks like a nightmare. this is a, a dining table with like a flat top, that a weird crisscrossed are very arty, legs holding it up. that is not the worst part, the worst part of the dining chairs that are around it, they look very soft and comfortable.\nBut these are hurting my back even to look at, these are making me very sad. I do appreciate the, the microphone boom arm that, that I bullied Robin into getting. So that’s why that’s working very nicely.\nRobin: we can put the\nTris: Do IS Yeah. Yeah. As long as you’re happy with it. but yeah, we can put it in the show notes.\nThat sounds good. am I seeing a Mac wireless keyboard in front of you there? Oh my God. We will return to that,\nRobin: I’m\nTris: at least the laptop. Hmm.\nRobin: I love, like I know, I know. I think our taste in keyboards is, is very different.\nTris: Great. Great, great. I’m happy for you. it’s obvious that Apple just struck gold 20 years ago on the perfect land, and they’ve never needed to update it since. That’s so lucky for them. what fits on a tiny laptop is also perfect on the big desktop.\nRobin: the keyboard layout a different\nTris: Yeah, I agree. I agree. However, behind the keyboard, there is a, a Mac laptop on a little stand, bringing it up slightly higher, that looks a bit better.\nAnd then there’s a, a large screen off to the right,\nRobin: Yeah.\nBites, back &amp; buns\nTris: this isn’t the worst thing, but you an internet professional, a programmer, someone who probably sits here for a lot of time, real nightmare, real nightmare. I’ll tell you why I’m what made me so passionate about.\nAbout this sort of thing,There was a blog by Scott Hanselman, called Brain Bites, back and Buns, the Programmer’s Priorities.\nhe wrote this in October of 2011. And the TLDR is that if you are a programmer, That was his primary audience. But I think probably it applies to anyone who works with computers for a living brain Bites back and buns you.\nInvest in all these things. You should not be afraid to like spend real, real good money on this. [00:05:00] It’s similar to spending on your health, which everyone would recommend. You know, don’t be afraid investing in your health if you know as much as one can afford.\nRobin: Yeah. Yeah.\nTris: So the buns part is what you’re sitting on. Don’t be afraid to spend on your chair.\nTris: The back was your bed. Don’t be afraid to buy a nice, comfortable bed with a good mattress that fits you.\nRobin: Oh,\nTris: There’s nothing worse than,\nRobin: bit, because to\nTris: yeah.\nRobin: To me, sleep is the thing that you really should invest in. Like, I think I, I think I, I, I saw a quote, which I completely agreed with that it was like,\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: sleep is the solution to all problems. Basically.\nTris: Oh my God, I love that.\nI couldn’t agree more as someone who has both back problems and insomnia. I couldn’t agree more.\nRobin: but I’ve got a bit better. Yeah.\nTris: No, I’ve seen your, commit times. no, you, you don’t sleep great. so back was like bed, make sure you have a nice, comfortable bed. Make your back is very, is very worth investing in.\nTris: And then bites he was saying. don’t struggle with a slow, bad computer. Don’t struggle with a bad screen that has bad reflections or isn’t the right resolution for you.\nyou are touching this thing all day, every day. Make it nice and ergonomic and make it fast for programming because that’s what he was focusing on. we programmers, we make a little change in the editor and then look at the website or recompile the program and see what we’ve done.\nthat loop of compiling or refreshing the browser and then making another tweak. And then based on that feedback, doing it over and over and over again. If you can shave one second off that, and it happens every 10 seconds, you’ve saved enormous amounts of time over the course of the day just in very small increments.\nSo yeah, fast, fast bites.\nRobin: limit this point of programmers, like I think with my parents\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: The furthest thing from programmers. You can imagine. I dunno if you mind me sharing this, Trish, but you said your mom just did her first poor request.\nTris: Oh my God, my mom,\nRobin: is so far\nTris: 76. Age 76. Mom did her first pr. I am so proud. She got it all wrong, but she’s learning. Oh, what a what a what A woman.\nRobin: Yeah. That is so cool. but anyway, I’ve had this big argument with them about how important it’s for them to, to optimize their internet connection. They have a really bad internet connection and they have options, but they’re just not focusing on it. And I think that they find daily life and the management of daily life really difficult.\nAnd if they just improve their internet connection, the amount of difference that would make to how easily they could manage daily life would be immense. Even with them, I mean, obviously they don’t use the internet as the extent that I do, but just\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: able to WhatsApp the family, you know, they’re not doing it properly because it feels sluggish and so they put it off\nthe\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: of having latency In your communication tech are just huge on everybody. I mean?\nTris: If it affects everything, like just a slight delay in the web browser, a slight delay in reading messages, it’s the, the same point,all those seconds add up to years of waiting. And I think, I’m not sure I’ve, I’ve forgotten if this is mentioned in the article or not, for me personally, worse than the waiting is the temptation to switch to a different tab.\nWhile I’m waiting.\nRobin: yeah,\nTris: So if something takes 10 seconds to load, I’ll tab over to something else and I could be there for half an hour, you know, scrolling, getting distracted, whatever.\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: so that was bites. And the last one is brain Scott recommends, investing in your brain, your education, your sleep, buying and reading books, getting a mentor, stuff like that.\nI’ll link the article in the show notes for everyone.\nRobin: I think it’s absolutely true. it could be doing the research on the topic we’re gonna talk about.\nRobin’s desk plans\nTris: Right. Absolutely. So I’ve described this, horrific, working space. You’ve got, what are your dreams for this?\nRobin: it has to go away out of the way.\nI mean I could send you a picture of this, but I have a little space behind my main door that comes into the living room.\nthat little alcove there, that’s behind the door and it creates this little, dead space behind it that’s about three feet wide. and then as deep as the door I suppose,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: you could just slide a desk back into there if it fitted and that would be outta the way.\nTris: Gotcha.\nI can often work quite well. Mm-hmm.\nLaptop &amp; screens\nRobin: So, so I want that. I like to have my laptop a little bit raised, so it’s in line with my eye.\n’cause up to now I’ve always worked with my laptop screen and then a monitor next to it, as you can see in my photo.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: option would be. Two monitors close my laptop. Right.\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: which would be better because then I could have monitors of the same size I don’t think I need three per se. I kinda have three when I go into work, and I don’t think it makes me any more efficient.\nI think I just sort of lose stuff slightly out of my view on the other side,\nTris: Yeah, I think that actually I, I used to have like as many monitors as possible, and then I switched to an [00:10:00] ultra wide monitor, which is twice as wide as a regular monitor. It’s like two, four by three monitors glue together. And that was cool for a bit. But I think actually that what works extremely well for me is a 4K monitor as large and as cheap as I can find.\nand that is what I’m working at, working with now. And I occasionally throw in a small secondary monitor to put video calls on or notes or something. But a 4K monitor is so big that I tile all my windows out. That that’s, I suppose that’s where we are. We’re different. I’ve got a really good,\nRobin: where we’re different. Yes.\nTris: uh, okay, cool.\nRight?\nRobin: actually what it is, is if I closed the laptop, I’d have to get a webcam, right? my laptop is where the camera is at the top of it. And that’s really crucial because what it means is my biggest screen that’s off to the right of my laptop where I put my note taking programming, having Jira open those sorts of things so that\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: laptop much of the day is Zoom, right?\nAnd that way when I look\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: to, I’m looking at the camera.\nTris: that’s good. Yeah, I like that. I always make sure my monitors are in a configuration where whatever video chat I’m looking at, it’s so close to where my camera system is. That’s nice.\nRobin: that setup, so I’d probably keep that setup. I probably just have a monitor to the right and my laptop, on a stand like I do at the moment so that I can use it for video as my video call screen. You know, I do a lot of video\nTris: Yeah, I think so. There, you’re limited in, in flexibility by having this Mac, because I, one of the reasons that Apple don’t let MAC screens fold back far enough is to make them more annoying on the desk so that you buy more screens. You know, they’re a hardware company. Everything that they do is, is designed with encouraging you to buy more, more hardware conspiracy, maybe,\nRobin: for, that’s an natural decision they made.\nTris: No other laptop in the world does this. This must be\nRobin: no other laptop in the\nTris: designed.\nRobin: fold back. I disagree with that. I’m sure I’ve had other laptops that, you’d fold ’em all the way back. They break.\nTris: yeah, but none of them are at that, 120 degree. Like, it’s so suspicious to me.\nRobin: Okay. Yeah. This is maybe something I don’t know because I haven’t like, like I suppose if you, if you actually study the angles, then you’re like,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: that Apple have chosen is different from what everyone else is doing. I didn’t know that, but that sounds,\nTris: Yeah. I admit I have no sources for this other than it’s deeply, deeply weird. And Apple are extremely good at aligning their business model to making, to encouraging you to buy more hardware.\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: Of course, there.\nRobin: agree with\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: I just feel like, we shouldn’t make a conspiratorial, accusation without evidence, but I, do agree\nTris: You’re right, you’re right.\nRobin: the company that would do it.\nTris: Yes. there’s no physical reason. it’s a choice.\nRobin: Yeah. Yeah.\nTris: Hmm. So the reason I, the reason I was sad about that, is that nearly every other laptop in the world, that the screen can fold back much further. you can tilt that laptop up in a much more vertical position and the screen can actually be way, way, way, way higher.\nRobin: got a lot more, you’ve also got a lot more desk space because your stand\nTris: Yes. Yes,\nRobin: Yeah.\nI’d love a framework laptop\nRobin: if I have to work and I need a Mac, then obviously I’m limited to what Mac will do. But, love to get a frame. If I wa if it wasn’t for, for work, I would love to get like a framework, laptop and then that could probably, you know, do what you’re saying and, and go more vertical.\nTris: Oh, my framework is arriving tomorrow. I got a framework 12, soon as they announced it, I was like, oh, okay, great. This is a nice, inexpensive way for me to get into the framework, ecosystem. I broke my laptop a little bit when I went to Rust Week in the Netherlands. I just like threw it loosely in my bag and I guess I was like smashing my back around, so I slightly cracked the screen.\nand I was like, oh, that’s not gonna get better over time. and it was about time for me to upgrade, I do like the framework like Max are fine. we’re all working inside of web browsers and text editors anyway, so it’s, most of our time is pretty similar.\nRobin: totally.\nI’m very fortunate to have a pretty modern and powerful max, so I’m very happy with it in general.\nTris: Right? Yes. that’s the bites thing.\nRaging against Apple\nTris: Yes. Exactly. I’m on record at Raging Against Apple. I think the video I made two years ago was the unreasonable effectiveness of Linux workstations and that on that video, I received so many comments. I. I had to declare bankruptcy on reply to all of them. Up until that video, two years into my, my video career, I had answered and replied to every single comment on every single video.\nThis video broke me because the reaction was so strong.\nRobin: one, people had opinions.\nTris: They, yeah. It was 50 50. Half the people were like, oh my God, finally, yes. This, this, why is everyone so, so possessed by Apple’s fixation of having everything being metal? And, you know, the, the various things that I said\nRobin: But Apple\nTris: in the, in the video and\nRobin: of advocates like\nTris: oh yes.\nThe other half of people, were very [00:15:00] upset with me. and while they might be, well, they might be. I was, I was in insulting their religion.\nRobin: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Are I, I was having a fun conversation, a little, little sidebar that we might remove. I was having a fun\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: with somebody where I decided that my religion is actually panpsychism, which I love to talk about at some point\nTris: Is what?\nRobin: is panpsychism.\nTris: Panpsychism.\nRobin: don’t worry. we’ll talk about it. It’s a completely different it’s a whole departure.\nAn entire\nTris: All right.\nGet everything up off the desk\nTris: All right. I’m gonna look that up and we’ll talk about it later. so Brain Bank Buns and Bites, chair table, that sort of thing. So I’ve got some like fundamental suggestions for you, for whatever you do with a folding desk or whatever The first one is, make sure everything is up off the desk.\nthat’s just a really good rule of thumb. Like monitors, put them up on a stand, clamp them up in a, monitor stand that clamps to the table, an arm that goes up, and then it clamps into the visa stands at the, at the back of the monitor. That way you can get them at the exact height you want and you free all of the space under them.\nThey cost 19 quid. It’s a no.\nRobin: Yeah, I’m covered on that.\nLaptop vs screen position\nTris: and secondly, I would’ve said that large screen, should be in the center and the small screen that you use for video should be off to the side.\nRobin: Yeah, that would be a good idea. Like I think that basically, I feel like the monitor. It’s the more effective place for me to work. And I find myself working on the laptop screen and I feel like I should be working on the monitor. And that’s probably\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: the reason you describe that. I’m, I should just put it to the left and put the monitor in the middle, and then I would naturally be everything on the monitor, which is the better place to do it anyway.\nTris: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.\nWhere to put laptop for video calls?\nRobin: I suppose it then means that the reason it’s in the middle is because I’m thinking for video calls I want to be square on.\nTris: Well, I’m not square on, on video calls. I have my monitor in the center and my camera and small monitor. I put the video on off to the side, and I think it’s quite natural because you, as long as you are looking, when you’re speaking to the person, as long as you are looking at them where their monitor is and where their their faces is, and where the camera is, when you are speaking to them, you are allowed to look off to the side and typey, typey type E do some work or whatever.\nBecause it’s like having the person sitting next to you, you know, you, you look forward and work, and then when you talk to them, you look over your shoulder.\nRobin: is a tricky one because I feel a bit like, you know, when I talk to you, I feel looked past for much of the time, by your, by by your setup, which\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: could say is perfectly legitimate. I don’t know how much I look at people actually when I’m on video call, and yet I still want to give them the impression that I’m there centering them and engaged with them, if you see what I mean.\nTris: Yes, I consider this a feature. over the last five years, I’ve optimized my setup a lot, especially in the last three years of doing, mentoring as part of my no boilerplate YouTube channel. I really, really care about the ergonomics of video and making it as natural and pleasant as possible.\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: And I think if you have, let’s say you’ve got a laptop screen and you’ve got a webcam above it, I not knowing when the person is looking at me or looking at something else is, is no good. Like I would actually prefer\nRobin: Like, you know, if I am looking at my monitor, you’re going to see that. I’m looking at my monitor for sure. But it’s just like with the setup I have, I feel like it’s more like 50 50 where if I put it on the left, it might be like 80 20. Do you know what I mean?\nTris: one. Why would that have changed?\nRobin: Because, when I’m not actively looking at anything on my screen, because what I’m doing is, In my head and talking like I’m thinking about what I’m saying and I naturally just look straight ahead.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: I think that’s my thought. this is why I’ve put the laptop in the middle.\nTris: Right, right. Well, you should certainly shouldn’t optimize for, for video calls in that way. Right. you don’t have,\nRobin: to optimize your video calls. I think the video calls are a massive part of my life\nTris: I.\nRobin: what I’m kind of doing in my way. Which is different from yours.\nTris: Right. Okay. So maybe the solution is a, a webcam that can then go on the main monitor\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: not staring at the small monitor all the time.\nRobin: maybe, maybe. Anyway, options. Yeah, lots of options in there.\nStanding desks are cheap\nTris: Yes. So I, your foldable desk idea, I have a bit of a spanner in the works, which is that I, I think standing desks are now so cheap. I’ve recently bought one for [00:20:00] my parents’ house. It was a hundred pounds, like a motorized static desk\nRobin: that actually,\nTris: and\nRobin: cheap. Yeah.\nTris: wildly cheap. flex his spot was the brand not sponsored.\nthey’re so cheap, like. Yeah, that’s right. Other brands. That’s what, that’s what we say on the B, b, C, other brands are available. I do love that. let me make a note of that. That is what I should do in my video is, I should say other brands are available.\nThat would be very nice. my point is that they are, they’re super flexible in terms of like getting the height perfect. Like your monitors are so close, are so close down because your, you can’t change the height of either your chair or your, your, your desk and changing your, like if you’ve got a nice office chair that had like a pneumatic raise, lower mechanism, you could get that a little bit better.\nBut being able to control both of them, you can get it perfect every single time.\nRobin: I was looking into desks, I I was looking at this and I, and I also was thinking that these motorized sounding desks are cheap enough that I don’t see why I wouldn’t get one. so I suppose that then leads me to think, ’cause all the ones I’ve, I’ve experienced are quite large. But I guess that’s\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: mostly experienced them. at work, at work we have motorized selling desks. Um, but\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: and so I was, just trying to look at how small they could be because I, like I said, I don’t need it to fold away. So if I just got a small one because the space on it was so well optimized by the vertical laptop and all the other stuff you’re talking about, although that\nTris: Perfect.\nRobin: work with my Mac though, does it? But anyway, I still feel like I probably tuck it away quite well if I had well optimized space on there. I don’t need it to be big at all. And then it can just wheel away into behind the door, you know?\nTris: Yeah, absolutely. Like the uk the the smallest ones are, are just tiny. where, how big is this? less than two meters across and 80 centimeters deep. Like you can get them really, really.\nRobin: less than two meters. two meters would not go anywhere near but fit behind my door. We’re talking about one\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: maybe less than one meter. I’m not quite sure.\nTris: Yeah. here we go. So, desktop size.\nRobin: if I got a 90 centimeter wise desk\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: then that probably\nTris: Oh, sure. You, you could definitely do that. I mean, they’ve got all kinds of, they’ve got all kinds of options. Like, you just choose the one you want. You can even do, which is what I did. You can bring, you can buy the frame, which is just the, the legs and the, and the mechanism, and bring your own desktop.\nSo you buy, and the frames go down really small, like well below the 90 centimeter minimum. You might be able to buy it outta the box and you just go onto eBay or some, like find a place that sells. Would at a specific size. I got mine on eBay five years ago. and they’ll just cut it to your exact size and then you just screw it into the, the top and you’re off to the races.\nTris’ fake mahogany (remove?)- Buy desk top separately from frame\nRobin: You mean. it is the reason for that, because only up to a point, but you can put a significant different range of desktops on the same frame because you can go quite significantly overlapping the edges of where your frame ends.\nTris: exactly. Yeah. You’d, anything you want, like that’s the ultimate customization that perhaps you should go for.\nRobin: that’s a good point.\nTris: And it’s, it’s so good. And yes,\nRobin: width of the space behind my door, for example.\nTris: and you can choose the exact color that matches the, the decoration that you’ve got, you know, light wood, darkwood or, or what have you.\nRobin: Well, the coloring in\nTris: Which is, which is nice.\nRobin: I mean,\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: Anyway.\n“Standing desks have been a miracle for me”\nTris: It’s a bit, it’s a bit Airbnb. I agree. I find stand, stand desk have been a miracle for me. They’ve basically stopped, they basically stopped me getting the lower back injuries that I, that my whole career has been plagued with. The, the big risk, uh, that programmers get is. When you sit all day and then you go home and you very often sit all evening playing video games or whatever you are sitting the whole time.\nAnd it was, I just kept getting lower back injuries. The, the primary solution is I should have been doing exercise, you know, I should have had a sport, I should have been going to the gym or what have you. But I solved it. I put a little patch over that problem by getting a standing desk and standing for most of the day.\nAnd that sidestepped that particular problem. Uh, I should make it clear to our listeners, you should definitely choose exercise and not this, but maybe both,\nRobin: I\nTris: you know, have a nice mix.\nRobin: working at a computer all day, regardless of whether you, you have other coping mechanisms, right? Like that is still something that’s gonna, that’s gonna impact on your frame, your body.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: and so, you know, you want, you want it to be ergonomic. I think I am, mean, I want to sit at my computer more than I have successfully been doing up to now.\nSo I’m, it’s like I’m kind of on a journey of trying to professionalize myself in actually staying put and, working on a significant thing my\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: So that’s part of what this, what this is gonna help enable. But I don’t think I’m anywhere close to the amount that I imagine you were sitting stationary, because I’m quite a.\nTris: Restless.\nRobin: Yes. Yeah,\nTris: Hmm. [00:25:00] You are, and I, one of, and I think you might find that in a standing desk situation, if you do end up standing with Bluetooth headphones, you know, cordless. You can just, like in meetings that are happening, you can kind of pace the room really easily and still be at the same eye level as your, as your monitor.\nSo it’s easy to go forward, back, forward back. This is what I do when I’m, when I’m drafting, get doing the final drafts of my videos, is that I’m reading the script out loud into an empty room and then like pacing as I’m doing it, trying to redraft, make, make the sentences sound better, pop better, flow better.\nlike walking is great for thinking.\nRobin: Yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah,\nRobin’s chair and carpet\nTris: Yeah. So the chair I see you’ve written, you’ve written something in our notes about the chair.\nRobin: Well, it just has to, it has to work on carpet. I mean, I think most desk chairs are kind of assuming a hard floor. And I\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: Like, I like to be able to adjust to shift my chair a bit left to right to be able to pull it in really easily. Like, I like it to be on wheels.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: but I, but I needed to be able to do that on carpet.\nBut I Googled that a little bit and it’s not that hard. ’cause I think they basically, you just buy the ones that have the slightly bigger wheels and then it’s kind of fine. And that’s what I read when I was looking into it.\nTris: Right. Um, probably, yeah. But, um, there’s, there might be an even more flexible option that you can buy, thing you can buy carpet protectors, which is like a square of plastic, like hard plastic, hard clear plastic that you just put down right under where you would be sitting\nRobin: I’ve,\nTris: and it stops.\nRobin: before and I think\nTris: No,\nRobin: I could experiment with it, but I think I’d rather just have a chair that just rolls over carpet, right? Like, I,\nTris: sure.\nRobin: it to be super rolly anyway, right? Because want to\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: I want it to be able to, I want it to have just the right amount of resistance.\nAnd I think. If you’ve got good wheels, that probably carpet might provide exactly the right amount resistance I’m looking for, because it means that it’s not gonna just randomly shift, but it will move quite easily when I, when I actually push it.\nRobin’s chair\nTris: Yeah, sounds perfect. There, there’s a, there’s a mechanism you should make sure you don’t have, which is a safety feature. I don’t know if it was a, if it’s a legal thing, like a regulatory thing, but some chairs only will roll with weight on them. So you have to sit on them and then move them and like unlocks the wheels.\nAnd when you stand up, it block, it locks the wheels.\nRobin: God, that sounds annoying. Yeah.\nTris: It, oh my God. Uh, when I worked at, when I worked at the government digital service, all of the chairs had this, and the ratcheting mechanism made it really loud to move them around and you couldn’t push them. You know, like if you wanted to push a chair outta the way it was locked, you had to sit in it and move it with your feet and then stand up.\nMy God, make sure you do not buy one of these.\nChair ergonomics\nRobin: Okay. Definitely worth taking into account. Yeah. on the ergonomics of the chair design, I can\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: decide how important that is. Like I got a chair that I was fine with at, um, you know, in my, in my old house, which is still there. Um, and I, and it was, it wasn’t, you know, one of these things that has a really shaped, like it did have a back that curves towards your back, you know? Um,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: the thing that I really like to have, which I think is probably against what you’re supposed to have, is a loose back that can, that can rock back if I want to. And like slouch, I can slouch into.\nTris: I mean, everyone is super, super different and the, the trend or the, the hype about, oh, how great this chair is, that chair is, or whatever, and people review chairs or keyboards or mice or anything that is like ergonomic, that’s a very expensive word. Ergonomic. If anything that is ergonomic, you’ve, you kind of can’t trust initial reviews because the rule that my physiotherapist taught me a few years ago is the best position is your next position.\nTris: I’ve heard this online as well repeated. So like, changing position is actually what is good for you. So if you find you buy a new chair and the new chair initially solves your back problems, but it’s, it’s because you changed, not necessarily because it’s such a magical, wonderful chair.\nRobin: I was at this, hippie Quaker week, a week ago. And there was a Pilates there that was led by this, this lady who seemed really, really expert in all this, physical, posture and frame and health and everything. And she was saying\nTris: Oh,\nRobin: good posture is always moving,\nTris: yes. Hmm.\nRobin: is that your body is responding to, all the different things that you need to adjust to just to keep yourself comfortable. your spine is an s is one of her favorite points.\npeople think their spine should be straight, but it just isn’t true. it’s a, s and it’s kind of like an s that moves around,\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: I mean, it feels very similar to what you’re saying.\nTris: absolutely. I mentioned before on, on the show that my RSI was made much worse by getting a DHD treatment. But because the, the meds that I was taking kind of cured my A DHD or they let, they let, they alleviated a lot of the symptoms, which meant I could focus more, but it meant that I like got distracted less.\nAnd from an ergonomic point of view, [00:30:00] it working for long periods of focus time is bad for your health. So it was good for my brain, but bad for my body. So you gotta just keep moving. That’s why the, the standing desk works very well for me. I’ve got an alarm every three hours and I go from sitting to standing every three hours.\nRobin: Wow, very rigid. Yeah.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: So we’ve spoken about screens, we’ve spoken about desk size, we’ve spoken about, you know, the fact that probably I want a motorized desk.\nchairs, it sounds like you’re saying there are lots. I can get one. it doesn’t necessarily matter. it just fits in with what works for me, and so\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: of that. Yeah, I mean, I, I think that’s really good. and I love the point about. How, it would be nice to have my laptop as a vertical as possible.\nTris: the general rule that brain back buns and bites espouses I’ve heard simplified recently as don’t be afraid on spending money on anything that separates you from the ground. So your chair separates you from the ground. Your bed separates you from the ground, and if you squint your keyboard and mouse separates you from the ground.\nRobin: that feels like a bit of a stretch\nRobin’s leftist podcasts\nTris: I’m thinking that we could solve the comment box problem by maybe having a button at the top of these pages that say, uh, click, you know, jump to discussion, and then it jumps to the bottom of the page.\nRobin: That is a\nTris: That’d be quite a,\nRobin: better solution. And I’m quite ashamed that I didn’t think of it myself.\nTris: so simple. Yeah.\nRobin: the reason I say that is because I think there’s of cases where, I’ve been faced with people trying to implement such things, they’re like, oh, can you duplicate this thing over there? so many cases I’m like, just do, is that what you’re saying?\nLike, just do a little link and send in the right place. need to like, recreate stuff all over the place. The beauty of the internet,\nTris: Cool. So we got a comment from, user scoop on our GitHub discussions page, saying Robin mentioned leftist podcasts. At some point I’d be interested in hearing any recommendations. so your chance to shine now, Robin.\nRobin: Yeah, so I was really gratified to have some interest in this because, this podcast definitely leans technical and, possibly towards software engineering. but my real obsession is much closer sociology and politics. so I care a lot about that space.\nI find it really interesting. I didn’t really know whether there’d be any interest in those sorts of, topics. So I was really glad to get this comment from somebody.\nTris: Yeah,I would say that in amongst technical audience, there is often an overlap with interest in, fully automated luxury gay space communism and that umbrella of things,\nRobin: Well, certainly in your audience. I dunno that every tech audience has that.\nTris: only the best audiences.\nRobin: Only the best\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: Yeah, no, I completely agree.\nTris: So I’d be interested as well. I don’t listen to any of these kinds of shows. and maybe I should.\nRobin: well, I think I’ve tried to persuade you before and you were just like, that’s too dry for me.\nTris: Yeah, yeah, that’s true\nRobin: Like they are dry, like some of these recommendations here are very dry, so you really have to be into it,\nTris: actually. I do listen to one, I listen to someone news,\nRobin: all right. Okay.\nTris: Katie Johnson’s, amusing show, but it’s all about America and like doesn’t have much impact on like my exact world. You know? Maybe they perhaps should be more, more targeted, more focused content I could consume that’s more relevant to me.\nRobin: Ah, right. Well, that’s a big feature of my interest, I suppose. Like first of all, I’m very interested in Americana. I think, there’s a reason for that, which is I suppose in one sense I’m a very high level thinker. I want to find global or possibly even universal patterns that describe or improve the entirety of human society, right.\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: and America has been for all of my lifetime and long before the global Hegemon Britain is very, very made in the image of America\nTris: right. And of course, the internet where, where we really live, like my body happens to be here in England, but I live on the internet, is a private American endeavor.\nRobin: exactly. that’s probably the piece. Yeah. Thanks for pointing that out. I think that is a huge part of the link is that I’m really\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: in, I’ve got that intersection between geopolitics, and technology. And technology is all American, like, at least, at least particularly when I was, you could say coming of age when I was a teen and early twenties at uni right.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: the whole technology space was just incredibly American dominated, right? It was like any other country was just an afterthought.\nTris: Yes, of course. the legacy of the internet comes straight out of literally an American defense [00:35:00] situation.\nRobin: Yeah. Even\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: Burners Lee is British, but,\nTris: true. Yeah. We got that.\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: played his piano, by the way, at Southampton University. He’s got a piano outside his office, so it was very outta tune.\nRobin: Wow. That’s quite a story. Oh,\nTris: Well, you’ve, that’s, that’s the whole story,\nRobin: Yeah. but what he was actually doing at the time with the internet was in America.\nTris: right?\nRobin: but yeah, that’s why there’s a lot of Americanness in in my list of podcasts. it does not particularly focus on politics, but I actually would love to find as rich, like, I don’t know if it’s me or if I just, like, what if I just haven’t found it or if they don’t exist.\nBecause to me, much of the people who are interested in doing heterodox challenging political, commentary and discussion are American centric, endeavors.\nTris: Right. I don’t think I know what heterodox means.\nRobin: right, so heterodox is, so you’ve got, you know, what orthodox means.\nTris: Uh, kind of, but maybe only in a religious sense.\nRobin: so, well Orthodox, I mean, obviously it’s very religious, but it really means, according to a single authority, right?\nTris: Mm gotcha.\nRobin: and therefore, by contrast, heterodox means multiple places, but also with a little bit of a sort of pejorative in there. Like, it starts with the same two letters as heretic, and I feel like there’s some, there’s\nTris: Right. Maybe like a lot of, like too many cooks maybe, you know, like if who, what, what, where’s the truth?\nRobin: not, they’re not, they’re like upstarts. They shouldn’t be,\nTris: All right.\nRobin: sort of thing. so I encountered it first in economics.\nTris: Okay.\nRobin: you have orthodox economics and you have heterodox economic theory. And heterodox economic theory is never going to be represented by the B, B, C,by the IMF, the\nTris: International Monetary fund.\nRobin: Yeah, right, exactly. The World Bank, the Bank of England,\nthey have started to take in some of what were heterodox ideas, but they do it very slowly. and the heterodox economists are very much kept out the conversation until there’s just no way to, hold it back anymore, you know?\nTris: Right.\nRobin: so that’s what hetero means. It means these theories that are forbidden sort of, if that\nTris: Cool. I mean, sounds good to me. Like heretic, you had me at heretic, honestly.\nRobin: but like I say, you can argue about the extent to which they do it successfully, but America’s always had the First Amendment and that’s very deep part of their identity, right?\nThe First Amendment being the one that protects free speech. so they’ve had as like a core part of their identity, this idea that free, that free speech has to be protected. And that leads to, there being a lot more places in America where people are creating a challenging perspective.\nLike they feel that they have license to do that. And I think Britain particularly is quite cautious on that sort of thing. So it’s hard to\nTris: Right.\nRobin: well-known British perspectives that are really challenging. I think.\nTris: Ah, okay. Mm-hmm.\nRobin: Anyway, the list, right? So,\nTris: Yes, please.\nRobin: as the, the, the commenter, as sc like commented only, Hours after having sent their first comment, they said, oh, I found, Robin’s blog post nevermind, which is a blog post that I had written, on the 4th of November, 2023, a long time ago, My Favorite Leftist Economics and Tech Podcasts. and it recommends a bunch of things, but, the podcast world moves quite fast and I definitely think it’s due an update. So I did put a little bit of an update in a reply to that comment, which is mostly what I’m just gonna say now, so, you’d have to go\nTris: Cool.\nRobin: it. at the time quite significantly centers around. The Intercept, which I would say has changed. So the Intercept, is, is his name Pierre Omidyer or something? Basically one of the, one of the eBay billionaires,\nTris: Right.\nRobin: decided that he wanted to create a media platform that had a lot of funding and therefore wasn’t, was free from, from other corporate pressure. And he, and he gave it a lot of freedom and it was called the\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: and the intercept it’s explicitly anti-imperialist is the first thing. anything that was about challenging American power, they would be doing. And\nTris: Right.\nRobin: also significantly lent into American Tech power. like, the way in which American technology would be exploiting people. they definitely had a significant thing about, about, Facebook’s, enablement of the Myanmar genocide. one of the founding, founding people who has [00:40:00] since gone rather sideways is Glenn Greenwald,\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: was central to all the Snowden coverage with The Guardian.\nSo that was before the Intercept, he did all that with The Guardian, and then he went and founded The Intercept with Jeremy Scahill. and then he of, went a little bit off the rails. He started being very involved with Fox News because at the time he was like, I want to go and give my message to the place where people really need to hear it, I’m\nTris: Uh.\nRobin: sympathetic to as a theory, but then he. absolutely allowed his himself and his message to be morphed into the platform that he was now very significantly platformed in.\nTris: Right. Yeah. They’re not gonna let you say, say things that aren’t along the, the lines that, Murdoch wants to do.\nRobin: I don’t wanna let him off the hook to that extent because, because there are definitely significant opinions he has that are very illiberal who is it that has a really good piece on that? so I’m really interested in like, journalists and journalism and like how you communicate the truth and how you argue about all that kind of stuff.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: I’m gonna have to look it up afterwards. That’s really annoying. but anyway, this guy is just fantastic and he has his own platform and he is very, solidly left wing as in like really well researched.\nAnd he did a piece on why Glen Greenwald’s argument that he is the true sort of protector of human rights while also supporting the police and, and these other weird things that he got into, is bullshit basically. Like he he isn’t That champion, it is a really, really good piece.\nIt’s very thorough, and very convincing. if anyone’s interested in the Glenn Glenn Greenwald story, which they might be like, I think it’s actually really important to do those things because I think I was one of them. Glenn Greenwald had a massive fan base I think he probably took a lot of people with him as he drifted rightwards, if you see what I mean.\nTris: Right.\nRobin: yeah, that’s really fascinating. So, the Intercept Great platform probably still is a great platform I don’t wanna say it’s not, but, um,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: Glen Gr left. And then for reasons that I am not a hundred percent sure of, and it’s a little bit amicable, but Jeremy Scahill, who used to run the Intercepted podcast and Ryan Grim, who used to run the Deconstructed podcast, who were both great, they went off and started, drop Site News, and Drop Site News and The Intercept clearly collaborated, or I think still do collaborate to a significant degree, but they’re very clearly creating a separation from The Intercept.\nAnd I think Drop Site News is now the more powerful, platform that the Intercept used to be. that’s significant change. And,\nTris: Cool.\nRobin: and then there’s, and then the things that are missing from my blog post, ’cause I’ve got, okay, in the blog post I’ve got like Macro Dose, which is actually UK based, that’s a UK based, uh. Economics podcast. I think economics and politics. There needs to be a name. Is there a word that I’m missing that like means economics and politics? Because the two things are so very, very related all of the time and everybody knows this, but there needs to be a, like a combined term\nTris: Oh yeah. I don’t know it. If there is one, it does it. I bet there is Deconstructed Is the podcast you recommended to me like a, a year or two ago, wasn’t it?\nRobin: probably. Yeah. Yeah.\nTris: Yeah. Yeah.\nRobin: were like, this is too dry. I can’t, I’m too American.\nTris: It wa Yes, it was. I gave it a go. I gave it a go.\nRobin: I mean, that’s entirely fair enough. Like I said, this is a very heavy way of listening is it’s just my sort of obsession. I’ve got my obsession, so therefore I, I can take the density of it, you know, but it is dense.\nTris: Right? Yes. This is what’s so great about, like, people like, Cody Johnson and, Adam Conover comedians who do heavily well researched, political and, and like topical, videos and shows is like, I can actually get through that. Me and my burnt out brain can actually enjoy and focus. Like, I can watch that for two hours, no problem.\nRobin: Mm. Yeah, no, I\nTris: Or listen\nRobin: with you. I think that’s really important. the other one that’s even more dense that I don’t recommend you try to listen to unless you want to,\nTris: me, me specifically,\nRobin: You specifically\nTris: yes, our audience can.\nRobin: is politics theory. Other, so I think\nTris: Mm,\nRobin: UK based. I think Alex Doherty is, British. it’s a UK based podcast, but it’s nowhere near limited to and probably doesn’t even touch on all that much, like, specifically British politics. it’s a lot more focused, I would say, if anything on like Israel Palestine. but PTO is. Really thorough, and I don’t know where they, where they get their sources from, becauseI want to have access to all the stuff that, like Richard Seymour, who’s a significant guest on the show,\nTris: hmm.\nRobin: to just know immediately about the latest developments in, in leftist theory, on current developments and just, I dunno how he does it, but it’s really fascinating.\nSo if you are, if you’re a proper geek on all this stuff, then I really recommend politics theory. Other,\nTris: Great.\nRobin: macro dose was, macro dose is really good for explaining p politic politics. no economics in it is, it is half UK based, I would say, and half more international.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: really good at, at summarizing that stuff.\nIt can be quite short. [00:45:00] it’s not comedy,\nTris: No.\nRobin: so that’s still true. And then I’ve got some, some more news, which you mentioned in the list. But the thing that I did never even put in this list, which I should have, I think I was probably even interested in it at the time, is, as you said, factually, which is Adam Conover podcast or, video\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: channel. and\nTris: Yeah. I like factually.\nRobin: factually is really great. Like factually, what I love about factually is like you say, the way that he does it is so high energy and fun like he’s trying to argue with people, and it doesn’t seem really serious.\nRight. And yet\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: most of the time, the experts he’s bringing on and the topics he’s covering are like really, really quite central and insightful and, and potentially transformational. I think\nTris: Yeah. Yeah.\nRobin: by factually in that way. ’cause he\nTris: Same.\nRobin: you know, his whole persona is as a sort of, not that serious person sort of.\n’cause he’s a comedian and he’s a, you know, but I think it is seriously good stuff.\nTris: I think it is. I’ve liked Adam kind of since he worked at College Humor and like his main show, like his breakout show was Adam Ruins everything. it really resonated with me because it’s such an artistic coded show. He’s like, oh you dunno, this exact framework of how the world works, let me give you all the information and then you are sure to understand it and, and think that everything is fine.\nAnd of course, just explaining something to somebody doesn’t make them fine with it or, or happy with it. And that was part of the show as well. Like, he’d explain everything like how diamonds for Engagement rings are a complete fabrication of the De Beers diamond company. And like at the end of the episode he’d be like, so you are not gonna get a diamond wedding ring now, are you?\nAnd the people would be like, no, we now we’re just sad about it and are going to do it. And if there was ever an autistic summary, it would be that.\nRobin: I mean, that is so true. I love the point, like, to me, in if you are like a a, a progressive political actor, this is such an important point about strategy that. You can’t go around being moralistic about everything to everybody all the time, because\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: is trapped in the system.\nYou can’t tell them to just not use it. if you try and do that, you are fucked as a movement because everybody’s gonna abandon you because they have to use the system. And if you make them feel too bad about it, they’re just gonna hate you because they have no choice but to use the system. Right.\nTris: Mm.\nRobin: I mean?\nTris: Yeah, I’ve, I’ve heard, heard that problem.\nRobin: turn your criticism away from them onto root causes. Right. allow them to give them entire license to use the system as long as they’re fighting the system at the same time. Right.\nTris: Yeah. Yeah. We all understand that we shouldn’t run our lives on the five internet companies that control all of our lives, but we are so ingrained with the, the, with society, which expects that all the way up to governmental level, that it’s not a moral failing to do that, it is just life.\nRobin: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And the,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: thing is to be on the right side of the politics as far as I’m concerned.\nTris: Yes, yes, of course. I have just subscribed to factually. Thank you for reminding me that that exists. I’ve, I’ve listened to like occasional episodes, but I should just subscribe ’cause I always enjoy them. I’ve got a question that I’ve, written in our notes here, is there a European focused, podcast show?\nI’d like something that is, like, what is happening in European politics, because I want to know more about that. I don’t actually like this, this small island with a weird king that we live on.\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: Like I’m is a bit depressing and weird, but I like the broader European,\nRobin: Yeah. Landscape.\nTris: stage. Landscape. Yeah. The broader, the broader European landscape like is so interesting.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: I’d be fascinated by that.\nRobin: would love to know of if anybody else, if anybody in our audience has any suggestions for that, I’d love to hear them.\nTris: Yeah, please.\nRobin: say the two UK ones in my recommendations, politics theory, other and macro dose give me some of that. They definitely comment on European, positions and developments in Europe. and there used to be a show called, that, I’m surprised, wasn’t in my list at this time, ’cause it probably existed at the time I wrote this blog post doesn’t anymore. That was, that was called, talking politics. that was with a couple of professors from, Cambridge maybe. they, they would, would also comment on European politics.\nand that was quite interesting. And it was from there, I got this, there was a topic I was very interested in, which I think I’m still very interested in, which was really about the way that the European Central Bank, like at some point there was this, there was this presentation I gave, I think at work, I think a canonical, just for fun, called\nTris: Cool.\nRobin: that I called the, the, well I called it Europe blows up, which [00:50:00] they might have used as a phrase in their, in their podcast. and the point of the podcast was that there is a sort of spending crisis in many, many European countries, which requires, Requires the, it would to fo to solve, it would require those countries to be able to create their own money with a sovereign bank like Britain can, but they can’t. And the European Central Bank is not going to give them the money that they need. And that’s going to lead to a huge sort of stalemate.\nThere’s gonna have to have some kind of resolution and it’ll be a hugely impactful for Europe. And it was really, really interesting and I haven’t really stayed on it since then because I don’t have that much European coverage and political coverage in my, in my, yeah, my feed, you know?\nTris: Yeah, perhaps, perhaps. if you do know, dear Listener, please go to cap state.com. Click on this episode, and there is a comment box, at the bottom of the page. You can click skip to, discussion. do tell us, or if there’s more in depth con conversation, we use GitHub discussions, on the, encapsulate repo.\nthat should be, that should be there. But while we have been talking, I’ve updated and we now have that skip two discussion, link.\nRobin: So there are a couple of things in here that are, that are tech focused, because I did, I did promise some tech, and I haven’t really talked about tech at all yet. Tech policy press is pretty good. It’s the closest you can get to a, a politics theory of tech, I think. so they, they, they, they have some pretty interesting topics. you’ve,\nTris: Cool\nRobin: each week work repeat is not at all political really, half of it’s probably tech specific and half it’s probably not. but like it’s about, you\nTris: it,\nRobin: running a team and honoring people and making sure that everyone has good morale and that kind of thing, which I like. there is, things like tech Dirt, is pretty interesting.\nTris: uh,\nRobin: yeah,\nTris: I think\nRobin: on the media was the last suggestion, but that’s very, very, like if you’re into journalism in America. And,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: and leftism. It’s got better actually on the media has got stronger and it’s become particularly relevant because there is an attack on wing media in the US by Trump. from my view, it seems like on the media has taken up the mantle a little bit of being an ideological center for\nTris: Ideological center.\nRobin: the concept of free speech in terms of, you know, progressive journalism against the Trump administration.\nTris: Wow.\nRobin: Yeah. So I recommend that to you and then\nTris: Amazing.\nRobin: over to you.\nTris: Right. I’m afraid I don’t have, leftist, podcast recommendations, but I do have podcast recommendations that I think will work with our audience. just three. I’ll start with the podcast that Inspired de capsulate, which is Cortex, relay fm slash cortex. It’s, CGP Gray, big YouTube hero of mine.\nAnd, Mike Hurley, huge podcaster, another hero of mine. talking about their creative process there, what they’re doing in their own creative projects and so forth. If you like this show, it’s a started off with like, the initial ideas were like, oh, I’d love to do something like that. so I’m sure our listeners would love, would love that.\nSecondly, my friend Ammos from Faster Than Lime, a fellow Rust. and technical YouTuber started a podcast last year called Self-Directed Research, which is sdr podcast.com. It’s Amos and a friend James talking about what they’ve been up to, usually rust embedded web servers, stuff like that.\nIt’s extremely programming heavy, which will work fantastically for some of our audience and not at all for the others. You’ll know if you are, really, really good, A very tight, short. They sort of give presentations to each other. the slides are in each of their episodes shown. It’s a very interesting format.\nand the last one is WB 40, which is wb 40 podcast.com. it’s a, web. Tech, creative focus, discussion podcast. my friend Lisa is a co-host, and she invited me to be a guest. I’ve not yet recorded. We were supposed to record yesterday, but due to sickness, we had to postpone.\nSo you’ll eventually be able to hear me on an episode of WB 40. And, that’s my three.\nRobin: Wow.\nTris: yes, the rest of what I listen to is perhaps I’ll put some fiction recommendations in the show notes, but I won’t go into it in this segment.\nRobin: that sounds like a good idea. you’ve recommended those podcasts all to me previously, and I think I haven’t, properly engaged with them and I need to do that.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: Cortex is great. W four is great. Like Amos’s, self-directed research is a trip because you get to see how deep the rabbit hole goes and it makes you one really pleased that somebody is going this into detail. And two, that it’s not you, that someone else is doing all of this\nRobin: Yeah. Absolutely.\nDemo to Robin how Tris makes his videos\nTris: so. I’m going to demo to you, Robin, how I make a video in obsidian. Would you give an overview for our listeners of what you are [00:55:00] seeing?\nI am seeing a title at the top ofyour document that says Obsidian for Students.\non the right And on the left of that, you’ve got the outline of the headings in that document,You’ve got it. my process for writing a video is to not start with slides and so forth, but to start here,\nI’ve just got a marked down document with some headings and some text headings and text headings and texts. I’m scrolling all the way through it. Occasional mermaid diagram, lover mermaid diagram. Love a mermaid diagram ca.\nRobin: really meaning to get really good at Mermaid. I don’t really use them and I absolutely love the idea and so many things support Mermaid and I really feel like I should just, do the basic learning to just be able to write one on the fly really easily,\nTris: absolutely. the killer feature of Mermaid, is, it stops you wasting timeMermaid, for our listeners who don’t know, is a simple text format that you can make asky diagrams, with boxes and lines flow charts or Gantt charts or a few other options like common diagrams that you just write in text and then mermaid will convert that into an image.\nwhat you can’t do is choose where everything is. if you’ve got a flow chart that has, a box and then you point the arrow to the second box, you can choose whether or not they’re flowing from top to bottom or left to right, but you can’t do anything else. You can’t click and drag stuff, like if you’re\ntraditional drag and drop tools, you’re drawing boxes, drawing lines, that sort of thing. If you’re really lucky, the arrows might snap to the boxes and shapes that, you’re working with. They might help you a little there and then when you move things around that might keep them joined.\nBut there’s so much fussing. There’s so\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: much moving at one pixel to the left, one pixel to the right. Are they lined up?\nRobin: Well, I\nTris: I was wasting so much time.\nRobin: for, corporate use. for your job. Mermaid is definitely not gonna be acceptable for all use cases. you say, if you’re very lucky, they’ll snap. I think nowadays we’re actually in a world where there are loads and loads of these tools that have realized that you are likely to want a box and then an arrow to another box.\nand so they base their whole interface around that concept. But you’re absolutely right that you are designing the layout of the thing to an extent that you don’t do with mermaid. Like draw io, lucid\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: charts.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: Miro, which I think maybe is, is Miro, that\nTris: Miro. Yeah.\nRobin: I’ve been told it many times and I just can’t learn it. I just dunno how to pronounce it.\nTris: I think it’s, because to me it sounds very like Milo, which you,\nOh yeah.\nRobin: aware of, probably because it’s a chocolate drink mostly in Southeast Asia or something.\nTris: I’m not aware of it. Cool.\nRobin: but yeah. to me it’s almost Milo, which is probably why I call it myro.\nTris: Tasty. Right? So those tools are great and you are right, you’d want them, if you are presenting to a client especially, you might want the perfect layout, pixel, perfect colors, the branding. But I don’t, in my notes, even in my videos, I actually, the value I get out of a mermaid diagram is that it renders everywhere, including on GitHub and on my digital garden.\nwebsite, namal.com renders there. And it’s not fussy or other, it is fuss resistant. I can’t be precious about exactly moving things around because there’s just no option. this box connects to that box and it will render in a reasonable way. And you can’t change where those boxes are in relation to each other.\nit’ll flow with a simple algorithm if you don’t like it. Tough luck. Get back to work, stop yak shaving. That’s what I like about it.\nSo I’ve got a load of mermaid diagrams here in my, slides in this obsedian for students, script.\nthe tool, in question is called present term, this is a rust powered tool that is just. The features keep coming. it’s got image support in a terminal. It’s got mermaid support in terminal.\nIt’s got types and latex and different font sizes like you see here where\nRobin: isn’t an\nTris: like,\nRobin: plugin per se.\nTris: it is not, it is a markdown based presentation tool\nRobin: I, I really\nTris: presenter.\nRobin: would be presenting your slides. I thought you were using like the slides plugin or something, and you’d be presenting them through the, something like that.\nTris: Up until five videos ago, I used the slides extended plugin, which is a fork of advanced slides, which is an improvement on the built-in slides feature of obsidian.\nRobin: Right.\nTris: Really, really good. But I needed both more features and less features.\nRobin: sure.\nTris: the built-in obsidian slides And slides extended, which improves it gives you a bit more, tweaking options and some quality of life features is based on, reveal js. So it’s an HT ML JavaScript, system, and it allows you to just write in some nice simple markdown in obsidian with some horizontal rules to delineate different, slides.\nAnd that’s what I did. If you go to github.com/eight man slash no boilerplate in the scripts directory, you will see all of my previous slides. They’re all like that.[01:00:00]\nBut this plugin, this tool, present term is slightly better for a few subtle reasons. I would say that most people should probably just use the built in slides, but people who talk about programming and might want to show, code on.\nTheir presentations might consider present term because it’s got some really good features, like it can execute your code or syntax, check your code so that if you make mistakes, your presentation breaks. And that was extremely important for me as a rust programming educator, because in my early videos, I made mistakes all the time, copy and paste mistakes like typos.\nLike if you’re just showing a blob of text that happens to be code, it’s very easy for that to be wrong and you’ll never know.\nRobin: Yeah. it happens\nTris: I wrote,\nRobin: Like I remember. So,\nTris: yes.\nRobin: so many times you’ll see slides and they will have code mistakes in them and the problem is that like often that is the only reference you have for how to solve the specific problem they were talking about in the slide. So then you try and copy it, it doesn’t work, and now you don’t know why it doesn’t work.\n’cause it’s not like a full of documentation. Yeah.\nTris: Right. Yes, exactly. Um, that’s another nice thing about having marked down as your, as your slides format, is that this document we’re looking at here, Atidum for students, will eventually published onto my Digital Garden website, namal.com, in exactly the same format. And that’s another thing that present term works very nicely with,\nAnd this is actually better than the built-in obsidian slides because built-in obsidian slides uses horizontal rules.\nTo chain, to, to delineate their, their different slides.\nRobin: Right.\nTris: And when I push this code up to namal.com, you see those horizontal rules in the page.\nRobin: Yeah,\nTris: we’ve got HTML comments for control flow, and they don’t show on the site. They are there on the site.\nRobin: in multiple different ways.\nTris: Yes, yes. it’s, extremely, extremely nice. we’ve got image support, it’s marvelous.\nthis is how I love to do my slides, text is the most important thing in all of my projects. the flow, the story that is vital,\nRobin: Yeah. very\nTris: the.\nRobin: and the reason I need to learn mermaid is because I feel like I can see other people at work like being power more powerful, because I’ll write like a very authoritative argument about a thing, but it’s several paragraphs and the number of people I get to read those paragraphs is diminishing. And\nTris: Right.\nRobin: can make a diagram, in a sense that’s a more powerful, so I need to learn to diagram better. I’m very text first in exactly the way you are.\nTris: Nice. Yep.\nRobin: you do the same thing. You take a text first approach and you turn it into a presentation rather than just a document that is a bit dense, right?\nTris: Right, exactly. That’s the secret I think with my, my videos is that they are podcasts that have a slideshow.\nRobin: Yeah. Yes.\nTris: at the top of this document, I’ve got four dates in the YAML front matter scheduled, written, published, and due. scheduled when I start working on the project written when it, it needs to have been written by, published when it’s published to patrons and due when it’s actually live on the public site or, on YouTube.\nAnd this is the same across all of my podcast video projects.\nRobin: this one. Yeah.\nTris: Yeah. Yes, exactly.\nand there we are.\nThat’s, um,\nRobin: Wow.\nTris: that’s the setup. Do you have any follow up questions\nRobin: And if anyone has further questions, obviously please comment on this episode. On to capsulate.com.\nabsolutely. It is a very useful thing for everyone to know. I think I kind of knew that this was roughly your process. I think it is very interesting to know that you are using that command line. Um, the fact that it’s command line does endear me to it a little bit more.\nI don’t love that so many things are obsidian plugins. When obsidian is a proprietary, closed source platform, it’s not closed source in the sense that it encourages you to create, plain text documents, which is fantastic. But nonetheless, if obsidian goes away or you need to platform into a different markdown, editor, take your\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: right? it’s very\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: have things that are outside of that.\nTris: Yes. I’m trying to de platform a lot of my core plugins. and that was another big advantage of presenter. Like if I go to my daily note here, we’ve got my calendar on the side. but if I bring it in from off screen, I have mimicked that in a terminal dashboard.\nRobin: Mm.\nTris: Um. Which only requires markdown, not obsidian. This is the, the,\nRobin: That is\nTris: is the supreme. Well, thank you. This is the supreme [01:05:00] advantage of having all of your life plain text is that You can easily build a bit more tooling or use,\nRobin: Yeah,\nTris: uh, complimentary tools.\nRobin: think absolutely this should be a a video topic of yours,\nThis is really interesting. I know that it’s like a shot at obsidian in a sense, but it’s\nTris: Well, it’s obsidian is the best tool for doing all of this, but it is proprietary and can go away tomorrow.\nRobin: And,\nnone of us love the, I feel like I’m, I know who is a fan of obsidian, they’re really like that because they are quite interested in open source and every one of them is frustrated that obsidian is not open source.\nAnd then there’s just something they accept because it’s good enough, but\nTris: Yeah, the what’s nice is that the plugins are mostly open source. Nearly every plugin has a GitHub page. Of course, it needs the framework of obsidian to, to make sense and to actually render, but a lot of the logic could be fairly easily ported. But it, it’s not perfect. a lot of people ask me, why am I using obsidian?\n’cause it’s closed source and shouldn’t I use something else? I would love to. There is nothing else.\nRobin: Yeah,\nTris: the complexity that I need to run my life and my systems. Like, people say, well, couldn’t you use org mode or Loge or Joplin or, and like those, you know, you can mention 20 or so others, they’re all garbage.\nThey’re all simple note-taking tools, and I have transcended their ability to handle the complexity of my life. Like I, I need way more than that. and it’s not even that other proprietary apps can satisfy me. Like Todoist is a fine to do system, but that is not the level of complexity that I need to run my life.\nRobin: it works very well for you. I mean, but, but\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: this is an example of that point I was making about progressive movements. Like, I’m not telling you don’t use obsidian, but I think it is\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: for you to explain the ways you’ve discovered that you can. Inoculate yourself in places against the centralization of obsidian, right? Because that\nTris: Right.\nRobin: that’s then the political movement.I would describe it as of,\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: building resiliency and extracting from this centralized system which we, which we nonetheless have to work with. and similarly I think it’s, it’s, you know, in the open source world, I think it’s very, very unhelpful for people to try and tell everybody they should be using like the gimp instead of Photoshop.\nLike,\nTris: Mm.\nRobin: crazy argument. It’s sucks compared to Photoshop. Like,\nTris: It is so bad.\nRobin: I mean, I’m\nTris: I use,\nRobin: offend\nTris: I,\nRobin: our audience, but like,\nTris: I I, I use it every day. it’s my primary image editor, and it sucks compared to Photoshop.\nRobin: right. so don’t go around and tell people they should use the gimp. Go around and figure out why it is. The gimp is so much worse. And take that seriously and don’t just deny it and pretend that it’s not true, and\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: figure out how you can improve things.
