Hi folks, my name is Tris. I’m a podcaster and video producer, I’m a musician. In fact, I started out doing anything creative or in public by being a musician. My first career was as a web developer, and I did production on the side for 15 years, but in 2022 I accidentally became entirely self employed thanks to the surprising success of my YouTube channel, No Boilerplate. I am here with my friend Robin. Hi Robin.\nRobin: Hi\nTris: Tell the listeners about yourself.\nRobin: I’m Tris’s friend\nI’m nowhere near as impressive in my output as Tris. I am a father. I’ve always wanted to be a father and I’m very proud of, being a father to my children. I’m a big fan of openness and transparency and open source. I’ve been a web developer and team leader for about 18 years. I worked for Canonical for 10 years, I worked with what is now our mutual friend, and that’s how I got introduced to Tris, and then Tris got me a job at Canonical, we worked together there for a bit, and you know, we’ve known each other ever since,\nI have a lot of thoughts about how to solve technical problems, as well as, How to solve other problems, and I’m a little bit obsessed with politics.\n[00:01:10] Why are we here &amp; defining decapsulate\nTris: we are here because I love talking about tech. I especially love talking about tech with you, and there are some parts of my, video audio creation writer world that I’d love for other people to get a little insight into.\nAnd I found that speaking with. You is a great foil occasionally, although that is a backhanded compliment. But certainly you’re very good at asking difficult questions that I appreciate you asking. “ Appreciate“ in, like, scare quotes.\nRobin: I feel like I do sort of challenge you in a way that I, I’m surprised you’re okay with. I often feel a bit bad about it\nafterwards.\nTris: You’re right. That’s probably the perfect interviewer, or, host attitude.\nRobin: I feel like your interpretation of\ndecapsulate was different than mine. When you\nfirst said it, I thought it sounded like a great name. And,\nTris: Oh no.\nRobin: no, no, no. I think it’s good. I think this was\ninteresting.\nIt was interesting that you related it more to software\nthan I did,\nTris: Yes, because encapsulation means bringing everything inside an interface of some sort and bringing along the things you\nneed inside that\nto work, maybe through internal data and internal functions or something like\nthat. How did you interpret it?\nRobin: Well, I think, I suppose I think that decapsulate is maybe a synonym for unpack\nTris: I really like that word unpack.\nRobin: I do think that it was, it’d be very interesting to talk about why we identify with unpacking things.\nBecause I think we do, I think lately I’ve started to feel more\nlike I’ve noticed more that people around me are not as interested\nin getting to the details, talking about the details of stuff as I am. I have to be aware of that because particularly in work, there’s a lot of things where I’m like, if we were to think seriously about this problem, then we would define the basis of what we’re trying to achieve.\nAnd then we would work out what flows from there. I always want to delve into the fine details of designing the solution clearly in a way that other people, are often quite frustrated by.\nThe thing that people don’t seem that interested in is more like the focus. I tend to want to look at things from many angles. I think that you aren’t, you haven’t really discovered the truth until you’ve looked at it from many angles. And I think also, discovering the truth is really important. A lot of people aren’t necessarily on the same page as me in all those ways.\nThey aren’t necessarily interested in the truth. seeing things from a few angles and making sure they’ve found the truth at the heart of it. Do you know what I mean?\nTris: Yes, it’s one of the reasons I really like talking with you, wise people are full of doubt and fools are so certain, and you’re really uncertain you’re not persuaded as easily as I am of something, there’ll be many cases where I will state something I know you agree with.\nI’ll state an opinion or state some facts about the internet or technology or society or whatever and I will state it in a way that is not buttoned up and watertight and you will disagree with me and argue with me, which is confusing for me, well it was until I got used to it, and we’ll\nGo round a little bit and I’ll be very, very confused because you’ll be arguing Against\nsomething I thought you really believed in and I might eventually say don’t you agree with me and you say yes I do but not the way you said it like you did not present a good argument\nRobin: This isn’t a very charitable presentation.\nTris: No, it is this is how I would like to be this is a very aspirational way of doing things Annoying perhaps but when we’re talking about important topics It’s important to have the facts right and the take right? You can’t just say something that is too simple or oversimplified. Um, and this is because you are trying to find the truth, which makes you a great podcast host.\nRobin: well, we’ll see, see\n[00:04:47] Podcasts are great\nTris: podcasts, I think, are my favorite thing. To write and to produce because audio is such a personal medium. I just want to do more and more, which is why we’re here today. Thank you, Robin, for enabling my addiction.\nRobin: Is this the first podcast where you’re\ntalking as you,\nTris: it is. And I’m terrified because I’m usually no good without a script.\nRobin: I think you’re doing fantastically well, you know, your voice is crisp and polished and your explanations are fluid. I think you’re going to, listen back to it and discover that you absolutely don’t need a\nscript. This is my favorite form of podcast and I found it quite interesting because I remember, the party we had on Saturday, your birthday.\nSo happy birthday again.\nTris: Thank you so much. I am 38, if you can believe it.\nRobin: Your friend, who I won’t name because they haven’t agreed to it, said, are you planning on doing any podcasts or something like that to you? And because they. Understand a podcast to be what I also understand a podcast to be, which is people talking, usually a conversation, nonfiction,\nbut when I backed her up in saying this was also my understanding of podcasts somebody corrected me and said, the very oldest podcasts weren’t that at all. The very oldest podcasts were. More like works of fiction ongoing serial dramas and stuff like\nthat. Which I realized,\nTris: am not sure that either, point is correct. I think podcasts have always been just like books, fiction and nonfiction.\nRobin: right. Quite possibly there presumably was a first podcast. It would be quite\ninteresting to know what that was.\nTris: It would be. I’ve never even thought about that.\nRobin: typey, typey, typey,\nTris: typey, sounds of, uh, mechanical keyboard clicking,\nRobin: Oh yeah, your keyboard I don’t have a keyboard like yours. This is why you have a keyboard like yours\nTris: interesting.\nIt looks like the first podcast came on tape and was a 1989, radio program distributed on cassettes. That does feel like how, podcasts are distributed, except we’ve got MP3s nowadays.\nRobin: Yeah. Wow.\nOh, that’s really cool.\nTris: prefer podcasts, not just because I’m a kind of an audio person. I started out my creative career. So to speak was that I’ve always loved music and so audio is very natural for me two years ago my astonishing and terrifying on YouTube made me a Reluctant video producer, but the format is garbage I suppose it’s YouTube’s fault really The whole process is much less friendly much more superficial.\nRobin: Is it less\nempowering?\nTris: Yeah, you can’t edit what you’ve uploaded. Subscribers won’t necessarily see your videos. The story of YouTube is a story of Lower and lower empowerment for the people creating and watching it.\nBut I will accept their money. And the enormous reach, that the platform, has given me, No complaints there, of course. It is a garbage platform, however. But I think you have to have a garbage platform to accept the benefits of a garbage platform, which is they will put your content in front of people who want to see it.\nWhereas with a podcast, you’ve got nothing. You’ve got an RSS feed, and that’s it.\nRobin: But you can have huge success with it. Obviously people have,\nTris: You certainly can. It’s much more word of mouth, which seems much nicer if you recommend a podcast to your friend That’s the only way it can work.\nRobin: Yeah. I love podcasts for that reason. I think what you were saying about audio versus video is that you feel like the amount of depth of control that you get and, it’s this really rich format. And I feel like that, that also goes with the control you have in, understanding your software and being a geek that likes, likes to configure things.\nAnd that’s also the other real strength of podcasts because they have resisted, the enshittification of all these other mediums. Podcasts are a standout success the world over. And they are not under anyone’s control.\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: And it’s quite amazing. Like in the modern world where everything is monopolized, it is really quite astonishing that\npodcasts exist\nTris: Yes, it’s wonderful as our dark forces at work to stop that you’ve heard of audible originals\nRobin: I don’t know that I have.\nTris: It is a marketing thing that Amazon do, where they say we’ve paid a huge amount of money to these celebrities and they’re making an Audible original podcast. What that means is an exclusive podcast because they want to make the walls of their ward garden higher.\nRobin: Absolutely.\nTris: Same with Apple and the same with Spotify.\nSpotify are the last of the game, but there are, Spotify exclusives. And they are not on any other platform.\nRobin: The most famous Spotify exclusive for a while was Joe\nRogan.\nBut it failed. Joe Rogan published exclusively for Spotify for, I don’t know, like a year or something. And then, didn’t renew.\nIt wasn’t working. The interesting thing about those stories is yes, they are all trying to do it. Every one of these monopolies wants to steal podcasting and put it in a walled garden. But none of them are particularly successful. Like, I hadn’t really heard of Audible Originals.\nI’m probably an anomaly. I automatically knee jerk react against using Amazon products and stuff like that. So, I’m not representative of most people, it’s clearly not succeeding in monopolizing anything,\nI don’t think.\nTris: It’s wonderfully democratic. And I think we have, to shout out, Aaron Schwartz, the creator of RSS, the late and great. Aaron Schwartz for making such a, an incredible simple system that just spread like wildfire before anyone could lock it down. think the huge success of RSS really helped get ahead of these corporations.\nRobin: absolutely, yeah, oh Aaron Schwartz, I’m always so sad, it’s such a generational thing, isn’t it? It really ages me. It kind of like I’m I mean ages in the sense of like you can tell my age by the fact that I’m so triggered by the name Aaron Schwartz because it was such a thing of our\ngeneration.\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: which probably means a lot of the\nlisteners might not know what we’re talking\nTris: In one of my videos where I mentioned RSS, I put a half second slide with a whole bunch of texts being very angry, not super angry, but like telling people to go find out what happened and don’t forget.\nthe Wikipedia page for Aaron Schwartz tells you everything you need to know. A real shame,\n[00:11:02] From Podcasting to Blogging\nRobin: You were talking about your enthusiasm for podcasting. I think I have always had a fascination and an enthusiasm for writing,\nbut I’ve never really managed to Properly inhabit it. I’ve always been so like, something. So scared of it or something. Maybe it’s too big for me. And I’ve always procrastinated So I do have a blog where I’ve published, hundreds of articles, over many years, but that amounts to like a few a year and that is pathetic output. And I wouldn’t say any of them are particularly impressive works people are welcome to check it out.\nI am very much looking forward to exploring. How I could engage myself with, my genuine interests having better output, a better connection between what I’d really like to say, or do, or what I’d enjoy expressing and, actually noting it down somewhere making an impact.\nI think the fact that you’re so prolific at that. I really appreciate it because it’s I think if I could learn any, like a fraction of what you do, I think I would really,\nit would make a big difference to\nTris: Well, It is a lot easier writing fiction than it is writing nonfiction. I think that there are some components, some building blocks of fiction and nonfiction that are, different. I write both, nonfiction videos and fiction podcasts and when I sit down to write my 400.\nWords every morning for lost terminal. Those words just flow out of my fingers because I don’t have to look anything up. I’m inventing it completely whole cloth. The world is completely up to me. You know, it’s still our world, but it’s set in the future, so there are some physical constraints.\nI’m able to just write things, whatever the characters say, it all comes from creative writing. Whereas when I’m writing a script for a video, there’s a lot of back and forth. There’s a lot of checking of figures, copying of code, making sure that I’m right, and getting all of the little details right.\nIn non fiction, that slows you down, compare Stephen King’s output to the output of somebody writing in the non fiction space.\nRobin: Some people write business books incredibly fast. Don’t\nthey?\nTris: but\nRobin: you’ve got Cory Doctorow, who is worth bringing up because he’s very much in the\nspace around Aaron Schwartz\nAnd also, you know, we’ve referenced enshittification but he publishes new articles. Daily, basically, as far as I’m aware I feel like there is a way to do nonfiction, which is where if you tell it as a story, even though it’s nonfiction, if you can figure out how to tell a story. That doesn’t make, possibly false claims.\nIt only talks about, themes that you already know to be true. I think it’s possible, especially as you get older, you get more experienced and you have, you are a genuine expert in things. It is perfectly possible, to stay within the space where the truths you hold are truths.\nYou don’t need to spend a lot of time finding sources\nfor them.\nDoes that make\nsense?\nTris: I think you might have changed my mind. I’m not familiar with writing non fiction as much as I am familiar with writing fiction. Perhaps this unfamiliarity\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: It means that I’ve not figured out, because you’re right, Corey writes so much stuff\nconstantly.\nSo perhaps the problem is between my keyboard and my chair.\nRobin: I think that’s partly because Corey is probably first a storyteller\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: I’ve never really done fiction. I fall into exactly what you’re saying. I start to try to write and I’m getting better at it, but it used to be the case.\nAnd it still is to some extent that I would start to try and write a thesis effectively about, something that I thought was really true and really important. Then I would second guess myself on every, few words and I would have to go off and find verifiable sources draw them together and then reword and made sure that I’d chosen the exact accurate word.\ndescribe the reality that I’ve now, spent the last half hour researching. And it’s you’re right. It’s actually impossible to produce a whole article that way. There’s no time. But I think I’ve got better. I’ve very slowly over many years honed my ability to lean into the story a little bit more and let go of the anxiety about accuracy,\nTris: I think my detractors would say that’s how I write my videos, not worrying too much about accuracy. And they are not wrong in many instances.\nYou’re here listening to my opinion about these languages or whatever. That only takes you so far. And I’m learning more to do due diligence.\nRobin: Your videos are well sourced, and you do the errata thing as well, which is very responsible, they are broadly, like, very reliable and good sources of information, but they are also highly opinionated, and so what you’re doing primarily is you’re saying, from my experience, this is my opinion. And so the main story you’re telling is not one that is highly sourced. That bit, the this is my experienced opinion, doesn’t need sources. And that’s why you can, produce a very good video pretty\nquickly.\nTris: Yeah, think you’re exactly right.\nRobin: That’s fascinating. Hopefully, through this, I can find my voice a little bit.\n[00:16:04] What is this podcast all about\nTris: What is this podcast all about? What can the listeners expect from you and I?\nRobin: Yeah, when you, pitched this to me. I don’t know if you pitched it. I think you were like, let’s do a podcast. And I was like, hell yes. But, but what I imagined is that, we would get to talk about all of the things that we argue about, argue is a strong word that we talk about in real life, which I always find really fascinating.\nI think the way that we, the way that we refine, what’s the correct, understanding of a particular topic. It’s just really fun. I’ve always really enjoyed it with you. And I think that’s, what I immediately knew that we would be doing in a podcast like this. And that’s the sort of way that I’ve always wanted to express myself to the world.\nAs this is my truth of how I understand things, that’s the thing that I want to share.\nTris: right there are enough podcasts in the world of two bros agreeing with each other and not challenging each other enough. Just a lot of agreements like The listener probably agrees with them, they probably agree with each other, and it’s just a lot of quite surface level stuff.\nWhereas, when you and I talk, I find that we disagree a lot about things we generally agree about, and doing that allows us to get to the heart of things, get to the centre of things, decapsulate it, perhaps. We should just, talk to the Oxford Dictionary, see if they can just, like, get this word in.\nI’m sure they’ll listen to us.\nRobin: So that’s very interesting. You’re sort of drawing out a kind of USP there, a sort of unique selling point, of our podcast, which is about, a confrontation, like a little more confrontational, not aggressive confrontation, but a little more, back and forth, a little more challenging.\nthan you tend to hear, which is interesting. And I’d be interested to see if we can do it completely civilly, because I do think it’s important to do it completely civilly.\nTris: Yes, I think that is a feature of both our personalities that is very good. We, we can have arguments or discussions about the topic, not about you and me. It’s unpacking the topic. You have to have two sides pulling the threads to figure out what is going on on the inside.\nI don’t want to make the middle ground fallacy where, someone says one thing, someone says the other, probably the middle ground is the same. I know that is not the case. We argue to unamity quite a lot, where you and I finally get on the same page, we figured out a clear, correct definition of what we’re talking about.\nRobin: Yes, that’s right. And that’s what I’m always wanting to do with other people, but I so often find other, I’m not able to find the wavelength with the other person where we can reach that conclusion. It’s always that, we either just drift further and further apart, or they just don’t have the patience to take the time\nto reach the conclusion.\nTris: and our listeners are going to have a huge advantage over us, in that I’m going to be able to edit out all of the and miscommunications, so they get quite a clean version, rather than two people trying to match their parities and get on the same page.\nI very often find in conversation where it’s I’m talking to someone, I know we’re misunderstanding each other. I just want to get to the point where we’re both talking about the same thing. And that’s what the listeners will be able to get. It sounds really great, I wish we could have that for real life.\nRobin: Yeah. I think you and I are pretty good at it. I think we’re both interested finding that, that place. And we naturally, as you say, are not doing, we’re not trying to do ad hominem attacks, right? I think that’s really crucial.\nI think that’s really crucial. I think that’s really in between people in life. Um, people are jumping to this, these ad hominems. They want to, oh, the fact that you have that crazy opinion that I couldn’t possibly agree with means that you are, some kind of messed up monster,\nTris: Right,\nRobin: and once you’re there, there’s no resolution, I don’t think, probably. But,\nTris: I also think that this kind of, this kind of discussion, although it, I worry that it sounds like we’re going to talking about a lot of highbrow, theoretical, sociological, political stuff, but I think this way of approaching deciding a programming package to use, just as useful for incredibly concrete questions.\nBecause the secret of extremely concrete questions is that they’re not concrete. We, as programmers, we have to, at the start of a project, choose various technologies to use. Are we going to use WordPress? Are we going to use Ruby on Rails? Are we going to Just get a square space, a site for this, which, which is the right way to go.\nAre we going to have a completely bespoke thing or are we going to do whatever? And in those discussions, though perhaps to the unassuming listener, they might think, just going to talk about the positives and negatives. Of course, that is not what happens.\nDave, Dave who has only ever used Ruby on Rails, of course wants to use Ruby on Rails. Alice, who’s only ever used Squarespace, only wants to use Squarespace. Like we all bring our biases to the table. So this way of talking, we plan to talk about concrete web technologies or organization methodologies and as well as perhaps some more, psychology, politics or, other\ntopics like that.\nRobin: To me, this is, really central to good engineering. I look at the software industry in my bias, and I see all of these people who believe themselves to be perfectly rational, haven’t realized or confronted Their own bias.\nThey haven’t inspected it. They haven’t considered the idea that they have bias. And they think that there is a perfectly rational meritocratic space where they’re holding on these discussions and coming to these great solutions. But in fact, there’s a class of engineers who, who have amplified voices in the room and other classes of engineers who don’t.\nAnd almost always what happens is that somebody confidently states truth from their perspective and, a vast majority of people who probably somewhat disagree with them don’t have the metal or the, or the power or whatever in the room to say so. And that’s how most engineering decisions are made in my view. So you’re not doing that, everybody thinks they’re doing this rational balancing of pros and cons exercise and they just don’t. aren’t most of the time. And I’ve tried very, very hard in my job and in my practice of software engineering to, really think about the social patterns that enable, that proper expression of the pros and cons all of the possible angles from which Ruby on Rails might be a better choice and the nuance and the different ways in which those strengths might be presented and the fact that each of those weights are very fuzzy, qualitative, quite likely unquantifiable statements that require an empathetic space where you can properly try and inhabit it. What sort of a user is doing this? What are they? What are they going to feel like? Why would they think that the optimization of this particular interface is actually going to make their lives that just feel that bit easier than the optimization of performance over there, right? Like it’s always this fuzzy, difficult space to try and unpick those.\nBut if you can reach a place of empathy and hearing all those points of view, you can, in my view, make the right choice. Do you know what I mean?\nTris: Yes, absolutely.\nThe assumptions came first. And the evidence was inconsequential. I think this is something that is common to the human condition, is that this is my experience of the world, and you trust it by default.\nYour gut instinct just, you know, Drives you around the world and occasionally your brain, you know, your higher brain wakes up and Thinks about things a little bit and wonders about the nature of the self sleep we all have the, this initial reaction.\nAnd then we seek evidence to confirm the initial reaction. And it’s something that I’m trying to work on quite a lot. I’m only really becoming aware of it recently.\nRobin: Yeah. And one of the ways you’re trying to work on it is by, um, having a obstinate and annoying sort of devil’s advocate that you talk\nto\nweekly on\nTris: it.\nReally, I think probably this is, like therapy. So I appreciate, I appreciate that Robin, and obviously your check is in the mail, um, as they say. Therapy is very expensive, I, I appreciate.\nRobin: Oh no, no, my, my services are free actually.\nTris: Well, that’s\njolly\ngood.\nRobin: I don’t charge\n[00:24:26] Blogging\nTris: so you’ve talked a bit about your love of writing and readers who go to your,\nblog, robinwinslow. uk, you’re welcome,\njust give me those advertising dollars after the show, thanks, we’ll see, dozens, hundreds are there?\nHow much have you written, Robin? I’m scrolling through now, and it is astonishing,\nRobin: It’s probably hundreds, but it’s such a low, speed of output. It’s over a very long time. And they jump all over the place. I probably should, uh, go through and Find the ones that I am most proud of and surface them up. That would be quite helpful.\nTris: yeah, like on YouTube, when you’re a channel admin, you can feature one video for new viewers to show on the channel page. And you can show a separate video for returning viewers. You don’t have to do this, I’m just telling you for interest. Here’s the one you show to new people.\nWhat is this all about? Why should I care? And the returning one can be a bit quirkier, which is quite interesting. Again, I don’t know if that is possible on your, static site generator. What I wanted to talk to you about is that you said you find it difficult to maintain focus\nwhen writing.\nI sympathize. Happens to me all the time. And also I\nnote that it’s been a while since you’ve\nwritten anything on the blog.\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: they\nlinked? What’s been going on there? Maybe I can help.\nRobin: It certainly is linked. I have a lot of things. I’ve always been overflowing with ideas of what I could write.\nBut the only things I’ve ever successfully written have been written in one\nsitting. I don’t think I’ve ever really Successfully written something and then come back and edit it the next day\nor the next week\nTris: Oh, that is an ADHD mood, isn’t it?\nRobin: yeah.\nSo either I write it and I publish it or I write it and it goes in a back drawer forever. I don’t know that I mind only writing and publishing stuff in one sitting. Actually some of the people I really respect are people who seem to just throw thought pieces up, immediately.\nEvery, they’ll have a thought on a day and just throw it up. I think I’d quite like that, I’d to be able to just be like, okay, here’s the thought, publish, done. I’d probably also like\nan outlet where I’m crafting significant works of writing. I think the thing that I’ve always felt would really help me there was like a writing, group. Or like buddies, like somebody who somewhere where I’d feel something of a commitment to this community to be doing my work and helping them with their work. And I thought that would help me.\nTris: I think so. It’s not November yet, but you know about NaNoWriMo.\nRobin: I do. How is it a community? I know it is\na sort\nof community but it feels, personal.\nTris: Yes,\nthat’s the joy and horror of writing, is that you sit in front of the page, and it’s just you and the page. Doesn’t matter, with your loving family around, with all your friends, with people online telling you to, get those 1600\nwords a day for NaNoWriMo. Like, when you sit down, it’s you versus yourself, I suppose. Um, is writing a mental health condition.\nI, oh dear.\nRobin: I’ve always felt one of the good things about writing, is it helps me anchor myself. I think if I did it more,\nI would have more confidence. You’re always saying how I’m.\nSecond guessing my own opinions and stuff like that, and I do, I come in with skepticism about my own position all of the time, and I think that’s actually been quite a limiting, instinct that I have, because to be able to make impact you have to have confidence in something.\nYou have to believe in, you have to, you have to be able to stay on a track, because you believe in yourself, when I write stuff, it helps to make it clear that is my opinion, if I could then, publish it and have, people notice and maybe even be interested or agree.\nThat would help me feel like my thoughts were worth something. I think\nTris: yeah.\nSo I think the NaNoWriMo forums and movement, tries to bring in a little bit of that. Because you’ve got encouragement, which is nice on one side, but can be a double edged sword. And you’ve also got. Accountability, and I think it is the accountability that really works for me because I never do anything unless I’m accountable for it.\nI think this is a big ADHD mood, let me know what you think. The deadline doesn’t matter until it’s in my face and I either put pen to paper virtually now or I am going to fail. So I’m suddenly accountable. I’m not accountable yesterday, but I was accountable today because the deadline is midnight.\nIt happens a lot with university students, but it continues through life with people with ADHD. Certainly it happened with me. Though I have completed NaNoWriMo once, Oh, I, it’s 1600 a lot. I don’t do that for anything. I do 400 a day for Lost Terminal.\nIt makes you accountable because you’ve got this deadline every single day. It’s granular, it taught me there are granular deadlines. I’ve got to do 600\nwords today. It\ndoesn’t matter about tomorrow. it doesn’t matter what I did yesterday.\nJust keep on going. That taught me a very important\nlesson. I\nwonder if it would be a useful framework for you to think about.\nRobin: I think it would be useful. The other thing I struggle with is, creating space in my day to\nsit down and do this stuff.\nTris: You’re\nRobin: know.\nTris: fair enough.\nRobin: You say that. But if you want space for anything, you have to create it. I don’t think that’s necessarily\ndifferent. Yes,\nIt probably needs to be done a bit more deliberately when you\nare a father, when you have significant demands on your time. But ultimately it’s true anyway, I think, and you’re very good at it. You have the things that you want to do and you make sure that you’ve scheduled them in and you’ve created the space I need to do the same. I don’t know that, I guess I wouldn’t even know whether once I sit down and say, okay, now I’ve got an hour to do some writing.\nWhether I would succeed because I’ve never done that.\nTris: A quote by Neil Gaiman, he says to be a writer is very simple. You sit down and put one word in front of the other until it is done. It is that simple and that hard. And that is how I think about writing.\nI never found timeboxing working for me. I’m trying to put tasks into my day and schedule them by hour or blocks it’s not really working. What does work for me with writing, is a word count limit per day.\nI schedule that, between seven and nine is my writing time. That is a legacy from when I worked the programming mines every day as a salaried programmer, because I had to do all my writing before work. That is the best time for me, because after work, I’m too tired, and even if I’m not tired, my brain is full of the things it, during the day, it’s full of sprint planning meetings, encapsulated objects, networking, and all kinds of nonsense, what I want to do is wind down, I don’t want to be creative, I can’t be creative, I’m most creative, after I’ve woken up, which is this slot.\nAnd so I have the slot where I sit in front of my machine and I have this small, really small, 400 words it’s a page for this 400 words to do and that is the only way I could do things. Lost Terminal the first season was not like this. It was exactly as you’ve described. I have to publish it in one sitting.\nOr I have to write it and finish it in one sitting. So that’s how I wrote the first episode, in a fugue state, after I’d listened to, Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Cranor’s podcast, Start With This. I got about five episodes in, and I was like, oh my god, I have to make something. And it was really inspiring.\nI’ll put the link in the show notes. It’s really fantastic. We certainly must talk about Start With This at another point. I’m going to make a note of that, Start With This. I just, in a fugue state, wrote the whole first episode. And then I did the same for the second episode and the third.\nI had to do things all in one sitting. The first season is really short for that reason. Once the first season took off. I had some patrons, people were giving me really great feedback. Only like five, this wasn’t a wild success right off the bat.\nThat was four years ago and I have about 250 patrons now, which is wonderful, but the progress is linear. There was never an explosion and it was quite slow and methodical, which at the time felt disheartening. You can’t look into the future at your possible success because that doesn’t really exist yet.\nAnd, so Season 2, I learned to be a real\nwriter and started taking one week to write an episode. Split over 400 words a day. That really worked for me. I don’t know if that helps you.\nRobin: I think it would help. I think you’re right. Being like, this is my word limit. And I’m more\nlikely to do,\nwhat I\nnaturally do, which is decide That I, haven’t finished yet and steal moments here and there to do the thing. So that might work.\nI also, like your idea of doing it before work in the morning, although sometimes I’m inspired by things during the day that make me want to, write stuff.\nTris: The way I think about when to write, I don’t know if you’ve thought about the best time for you, but the best time for me is morning. I think me and Salvador Dali think the same on this regard, is that I, and maybe this is why it might be different for you, is that I’m writing fiction.\nI am creating out of nothing, out of just my brain, everything that happens. I don’t have to do any research. I don’t have to, look up anything.\nAt least not for the creation part of it. It’s not synthesis. It’s pure fiction, pure creation. Dali found himself most creative When he just woke up he would sit in a chair with a bunch of keys in his hand over a metal plate and have a nap, just as his eyes close and he goes into that nap, he drops the keys, you know, sleeping, so his hand opens and he drops the keys in his sleep, crashes into the metal plate and wakes him up, then he goes to the easel and starts painting.\nDali’s amazing, we’ve actually got a Dali print in my parents house that my mum dumpster dived from a\nskip in the area that Dali lived. Someone was just demolishing a house and mum was going, walking past it, looked in and was like, oh, there’s a signed print of Dali in here that the builders have thrown out.\nI guess I’ll have that. So there we go. Now she has a signed Dali\nprint. When I\nwake up, I feel like I’m focused because I’ve not yet read Hacker News, I’ve not yet read Reddit, I’ve not yet watched any YouTube\nvideos, my mind is as fresh as it’s gonna\nbe.\nRobin: I think it could work. The problem is I don’t go to bed early enough. I think if I went to bed early, then getting up early would be much more of an option.\nTris: Did you find that things settled down a bit with ADHD meds? Do you mind\ntalking about that?\nRobin: Oh, no, I don’t mind talking about it at all.\nI’ve definitely been on the meds and stayed up\nvery, very late. To start with, I felt kind of wired into the evening.\nSo I thought the meds were still doing something\nand that’s not true anymore. Now I’m really exhausted by 10 at night. I basically think that the sleep thing and the meds are not exactly related. I had a more organized day, but nonetheless I get into the evening and there’s something that’s keeping me up.\nthey call it revenge bedtime procrastination. Yes. So I’m trying to get revenge on the world or myself or something. That feels very accurate to me. It’s also a shame\nand fear thing for some reason. Lately, like last week or so, I feel on top of it.\nTris: Aw.\nRobin: The meds are fantastic, and knew that most recently because I’d run out, and had four or five days without any. Got my 70, which is the high dose I’ve gone on to. And then I took it and the difference between that day and the previous day was so stark, so stark,\nTris: Hey, are we, 70mg elvanse buddies?\nRobin: we are, we’re exactly that.\nYes.\nTris: Aw. That’s nice. Yeah. That’s the level that worked for me as well. When I don’t take, I do intentionally not take them now and then. Very often at a lazy Saturday. day or a lazy Sunday or sometimes both,\nJust to kind of reset and check,\ndo I still need to take these?\nAnd it is very obvious that I do because I’m like. Oh No, this is what\nit was like. No, no, no, no, no. I can’t go back. This is no good. I need the good\nbrain chemicals.\nRobin: My wife’s been encouraging me to see what kind of services there are for more like ADHD counseling,\nBecause obviously there’s two different ways that you can tackle ADHD.\nYou can have the\nmedication and you can have, more like management techniques, ideally you’re doing both, but I don’t know all that much about the management techniques side. Like I definitely know some things and I’ve obviously got my own coping mechanisms that I had. before anyway. And I think quite a lot of those are quite helpful and I’ve got quite a lot of techniques, but, I still think there could be a hell of a lot more to learn. And I, think that would be good for me. So that’s another thing I’m going to be exploring\nTris: oh, interesting.\nRobin: know when exactly.\nTris: I’ve never, explored that avenue because luckily for me, I just needed the meds and then my existing coping mechanisms were working a little better I’m building all my own and I think about this all the time I’ve got a little bit more space to optimize my systems.\nI don’t have a family and a full time job. I’m just living the dream of a writer who can closet myself somewhere and keep on writing some of my writing is, to myself, about thinking about how my systems should work. When you have,\nThose sessions, I would love to talk to\nyou about it in a future episode.\nTalking about mechanisms for being productive seems completely on topic for what I imagine this show to be.\nRobin: Absolutely. No, of course I will be very happy\nto talk about that. I don’t know if they’re\nproductivity. I I see them as more.\nMacro psychological things than productivity itself. Over time, I have learned that,\nPossibly the biggest value that I can produce is in, confidently communicating my attitude to certain problems.\nI can see places where. things need solving and where a completely different way of thinking about the way to solve that or a well targeted best practice or a, process flow change, would make a big difference. Fortunately, I seem to be in a job where there’s a lot of opportunity for those sorts of things, and they’re incredibly valuable.\nThat means that, what’s required of me is not extended periods of focused, hard work. Instead, it leans into this meandering, Exploratory process that I think I have which means that I can see these opportunities and make good suggestions for them So that works quite well for me\nTris: Excellent, yeah. I look forward to talking about that at some point in the future.\n[00:38:30] Writing Disctractions\nTris: I would like to talk, if I may, about writing distractions. You mentioned that it’s very easy to get knocked out of the flow when you go and research something. Now, you’re predominantly doing non\nfiction and I’m predominantly doing fiction, so I’ve got a lot more that I\ncan just get into the flow\nand forget about because it’s all invented.\nBut it must be much more difficult with non fiction.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. So that does happen to me all the time. I think what happens is\nI’ll start writing where I’ve had some confidence, like I started\nwith some confidence about, this is my\nposition and this is what I want to say. And then as I’m writing it, I sort of realized that something that I’m claiming is not necessarily self evident, right?\nUm,\nand so then I need to immediately, I start trying to work out how to shore up my argument. Either I rephrase and rephrase and rephrase a few times. Or I go off and I start trying to read something to just make sure I’m like, oh yes, actually there’s this whole discipline here and maybe I didn’t explore that properly and it’s actually very relevant here.\nSo I suppose I’m thinking, always when I’m writing, I’m thinking of criticism of my writing. So I’m anticipating what people might, how people might come and tear down what I’m trying to say. And so then I realized that there’s this whole thing that needs to be read or researched or I need to go find all these links and I go off and I do that.\nAnd that tends to then, as soon as I’m off surfing the web,\nTris: Oh yeah, um, yeah, I get lost. I fall off the wave,\nI cannot imagine how people write inside a web browser. Like people who are writing directly into Google Docs, say, that means you have a web browser open. A tab is just a click away. I personally could not survive that environment. The way I write is by deleting everything. I even remove the browser on my machine, a topic for another time, but when I am in the writing mode, I don’t even have a browser installed.\nYou can do this with multiple user accounts or different devices, but I’m on NixOS, so I can do all kinds of weird stuff. And, because I just don’t trust myself. But there are places, even in fiction, just like with your, that you, just like in, in nonfiction, there are places where I have to be right about\nthings.\nHistorical things need to be correct, dates need to be correct, and even\nwhat you’ve mentioned about arguments and wanting to be correct, and presenting things correctly,\nthat of course happens in fiction as well, especially in science fiction, which is where I’m mostly writing in\nlost terminal.\nRobin: That did occur to me when you were saying earlier that because you’re writing fiction, you didn’t need to check stuff or something like that. You were saying that you didn’t get interrupted so often. I was thinking about the fact\nthat you’ve obviously come to our shared chat group and with things like, I was thinking of writing about this, what’s a good example of a sort of technology or something.\nCause obviously you do need to do research for that. There’s a lot of research that goes into credible fiction as well.\nTris: I’m glad you brought up our Telegram group. I would never have started that conversation in the morning. For me, mornings are on Do Not Disturb mode. And for huge sections of the morning, as I said, I don’t even have a web browser available. One of the reasons that I’ve standardized on Telegram other platforms would work if they had this one feature.\nScheduled messages. It is vital for me to be able to have a thought in the morning, let’s say 7. 30, and maybe I need to send a message to you about, oh, are we still on for the recording of of the podcast, later on. But if I send that to you, you might reply and ask me questions, and then I’m in a conversation.\nSo what I do, I think this is the first time I’m telling you this, What I do is I schedule a message for like 11. 30 or 12 o’clock or something like that, if that makes sense for the message, with my question. And so it’s captured, it’s going to send, and as far as my brain is concerned, I’ve already asked you the question, and it’s out of my mind.\nAnd then, I go back to writing, and I’m not distracted by your answer. Because even if I’m on Do Not Disturb, I might see your message and I might have a quick little look, which is risky. Having a glance at a browser or a messenger, super risky. So, scheduled messages, and indeed email, which works nicely because it’s, it doesn’t notify you.\nIf you turn off notifications, which you should do, it’s just a very asynchronous thing, I can move things along, but this is, I have a generalized solution for this that I think might work for you and maybe it might work for our listeners. The generalized case is to have modes of, modes of working, modes of thinking, modes of operating.\nAnd those modes progress throughout the day. And they always happen the same. For my day, I’ve got about five modes separated about linearly throughout the day. A writing mode, a research mode, a bit more of an online research mode, and then a discussion mode, and then at the end of the day I’ve got a sort of a relaxing gaming, or socializing mode.\nAnd what I do. Is I push tasks to a future mode. I’m gonna stop calling them modes. These are contexts, because I’m using the GTD terminology here, the contexts, so research tasks when I’m writing, I need to know this date, I need to know this time. I need to know this fact.\nAnd if I open a browser. I’m done or I could be done because Wikipedia is fascinating and I can always lie to myself and say, I’m looking up networking protocols from 1976. That’s actually on topic for what I’m doing, but it’s not really. It’s very easy to lie to ourselves about things that are tangentially related.\nSo what I do is I make a new task for myself, write down what I’m going to do, look up this date, look up whatever, and then I tag it with. The future context I want to pick it up in. Now you’ll note that this is very similar to sending a scheduled message that, that then runs at a certain time. This is that, but for me.\nSo my first two modes are the chamber, which is where the writing happens. It’s a very fancy name because I’m a very fancy person. And the second mode is called library, which is where research happens. Research but no chatting, no browser, or rather no general purpose browser. I use a separate browser that doesn’t have YouTube logged in, it’s got everything blocked, that sort of thing.\nIf I’m writing\nsomething,\nand I\nneed to think of something, I write in a\nlittle to do, and I tag it, library, and then I\nkeep writing, I keep the flow\ngoing. That\ngeneralized case works for my whole\nday.\nRobin: There are things about your process that I’m, that I’ll find very useful. And in fact, I think you might’ve been the person that really introduced me properly to the concept of scheduled messages.\nAnd I have made, I have made, significant use of\nscheduled messages since I realized how powerful they could be because they are in more and more places.\nI can schedule emails in Outlook. I can schedule,\num, I can\nschedule messages in\nSlack. In, for work, and it’s really the scheduled messages in Slack that I’ve used\nmost.\nRobin: And I do use them in that very way, I know I want to say this thing to this person, but I don’t want to say it now because it will start this whole conversation and I don’t want to, now’s not the time for the conversation.\nSo I definitely do that. I think there’s a big difference between you and me broadly in this kind of regimented organizational space because I’m,\nI don’t think I can be organized in that way. I think I will always immediately react against it. I need to have a lot of techniques that are at my disposal that I’m practiced enough to be good at so that any moment I can work out how to use them dynamically to manage myself better. But I can’t, I don’t think, say, Okay, I’m going to have this designed context, and I’m going to switch into that context, and now I’m in that context, and I’m going to stay there. And now I’m moving into this other context, and now I’m going to stay there. I don’t think I can do that. That’s not going to work for me.\nTris: Fair enough. It’s a very weird way of, working and I’m still learning how to make it work for me. But, so you, you need to solve the problem then of what happens when\nyou run out of time. You\nsaid earlier that you can, you tend to only be able to publish\nstuff that you write and finish in\none sitting.\nBut that is incompatible with being, with regular writing, it seems to me. Is that something you want to improve?\nRobin: I think I need to figure out how to\nnot just do that.\nI need to, I think the structure of my life\nis such, I think that the bit that’s harder to change\nand possibly impossible to\nchange is the fact that I’m\nunpredictable and my day is unpredictable.\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: And so I think therefore I need mechanisms that accommodate for that.\nAnd so writing wise as well, I need to somehow find a hook that allows me to. Pick up to continue a thread over, over a couple of sittings, which makes more sense to the way that I think generally, because I am a big fan of asynchronicity. I just need a thing to pull me back into it.\nThat’s what’s missing. What happens is I have a thought and I’m very enthusiastic about this idea.\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: And then I. I get started on it, something happens, and I drift off, and I’ve completely lost the thread. In the emotional sense, I’ve completely lost the thread of that obsession,\nAnd now it’s gone.\nAnd all I need is something that keeps a line back to that thought, that topic, that,\nThat obsession.\nTris: This happens in discussion. I dream of some imaginary system that keeps track of all the subjects in a discussion with friends. Because you sort of get forked off on one topic and then maybe you’ll come back to the first topic or maybe you’ll fork to a third topic and it spreads out like a tree and I might be very excited by number two and I’ve got a reply to number two and I want to add to the conversation and I’m thinking about it.\nBut then, oh no, the conversation is forked to subject\nthree. And I’m also excited by that and I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say for subject two.\nUh, sorry, your description gave me PTSD because this is how it’s like in every conversation I’m\nin. The answer, I think, maybe for both of us might be note taking or outlining\nRobin: When you’re talking about it with the conversations, I think note taking is that is very powerful. And I do, I’ve,\nWhen you and I were having a\nconversation live in, in, in Meatspace,\nIn London, you got out your, is it a remarkable? I’m not quite sure.\nTris: is, yep, best tablet. Right. Exactly.\nRobin: And you were taking notes and, I, I knew immediately why you were doing it and I think it worked very well and I would like to do something similar and that’s very helpful,\nbut that doesn’t\nexactly work for the writing\nthing. I don’t think, because obviously the notes are already there, because\nthey are the, what I wrote,\nbut I don’t quite know how to yeah, attach myself back to the thing. If I had a,\nif I had a partner, this is why I feel like I need other people.\nBecause if I had somebody else, that, that cared about it, then I would immediately, that, that would draw me back into it, and then I’d have no trouble.\nTris: Like pair programming. It’s much more focused when you’re working with a pair\nRobin: Exactly. Yes. All of the ways in which I have thought about good ways to program It’s\nfunny, isn’t it?\nI now realize are, me\ntrying to design coping strategies for my ADHD. And I think a lot of the software industry is, I think there’s so many things, even to the point of the features that get implemented in devices, things like dark mode and not just that, there was another big one that I was thinking of recently.\nTris: Like collapsing a sidebar maybe get that out of my I\nRobin: maybe, yeah, like I feel like there’s a, it was quite clear to me when I thought about a couple of different features that I’ve forgotten, but if they come back to me I’ll mention them, but that they were designed from quite a specific sort of psychological experience. Do you see what I mean?\nTris: I do this there is a point in devin price’s book unmasking autism that I think applies to\nADHD as well as autism he says very confidently and matter of\nfactly that the internet was created By and for autistic\npeople.\nRobin: Yes.\nTris: And though that is a large sweeping statement, I can see what he’s saying there.\nRobin: Yes. And it’s interesting that is denobias. And it means that we’ve built a global system that isn’t designed for everybody.\nTris: Possibly. I think there is a larger term for it. discussion about whether affordances for people with autism and disabilities actually often benefit everyone. Like ramps are great for everyone, not just for people in wheelchairs. I think it’s, that’s how I think about\nthe affordances for people with autism and ADHD, because if you can hide the\nsidebar, then that’s great for people with ADHD who’d be distracted by it, especially if there’s like notifications and stuff in there.\nBut actually, Even if you don’t have ADHD you\nmight want to hide the sidebar for numerous reasons,\nRobin: So that’s absolutely true. And I don’t want to also minimize the fact that there is a lot that’s not accessible or in tech all\nover the\nplace. And it’s horrible. And I discovered\nrecently something that I hadn’t Even\nthought of. I just saw this thing on\nmastodon of somebody complaining about captures and about how,\nCaptures are broadly not compatible with the screen reader.\nAnd so If you’re blind, and you encounter like anything where you encounter a capture, you’re just suddenly stuck. A lot of the time. And that was something that’s such a huge thing that I hadn’t occurred to me. I’m sure there are accessible ways to deal with that and they must have been implemented, but\nTris: Yes, very often you’ll find a capture has a speak button. I have\na play button that where you can hear the capture, but I agree, not every one and maybe not most of them.\nRobin: Exactly. I have no idea the proportion. I only discovered this morning, so I haven’t looked into it. But,\nbut yeah, No. So I don’t want to minimize\nthat. That’s\nabsolutely true. And I’m not claiming that,\nNeurodivergent people. Are broadly accommodated well by, the web in any sense. But I do think if you look at it and you look at some of those features, it’s not that they don’t help everybody. They do, but by spending effort there, you’re all, there’s always an opportunity cost, right?\nYou’re always not spending effort somewhere else. And so the sum of all of the places where you’ve chosen to spend effort represents a huge opportunity cost of stuff that you haven’t therefore spent effort\non. And I feel a bit like that might well be the case That software broadly, even in the things that we design, that have been quite, that we all think are a good thing, is skewed quite significantly towards a particular sort of person that’s overrepresented within The software industry. And I find that quite fascinating. And I also feel I’ve come to these conclusions about really good ways to run teams and all this kind of thing, and I think they’re really effective. And I haven’t seen any evidence that’s not true. I think my ideas are quite good ones, but they almost certainly are a lot more biased than I realized. Towards the fact that I’m trying to accommodate for my own psychological habits and assuming that they are general. When they’re probably not as general as I think they are.\nTris: I think that’s a very good introspection. Maybe I think\nthat, designing things for autistic people would benefit everyone because I am autistic. Yes, how would I know? How would I know otherwise? I,\nRobin: so I don’t know what you do about that. It’s trying to have a good diversity within the\ncommunity, isn’t it? Ideally demographically, everybody would be represented Roughly equally within equally to like their proportion in society, or something like that.\nI’m not quite sure but it’s an example of of how that how that lands.\n[00:53:23] Bottom-up Thinking\nTris: I think what this podcast is going to be is a large, wide discussion of our interests, which includes, but not limited to tech, internet, the tools that you would use in a. digital information world to project management to do Note taking that sort of thing.\nI’m certainly very interested in those and as well as Things that are tangentially related to our lives. I’ve got videos on non standard sleep systems non standard learning methods DIY computing I’ve got a lot of thoughts about AI and art and that sort of thing. But that’s only looking backwards at what I’ve talked about before.\nI imagine way more scope for us to talk about the many different layers of things that I’m interested in. I’m also excited for the other 50%, which is your contribution, what you’re interested in.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. So I think that’s a great summary. I think that is exactly what we’re trying to do. We’re trying to focus on the things we’re interested in, and we’re both interested in, understanding and defining those things that we care about as truthfully as we can, together, right? And that’s what this is about.\nI realized as you were talking about those different systems, like the way that it’s coding and the way that people might try and organize their lives. When we’re talking about all of those topics, for me, I suppose, one way or another, I always think about them as socio technical systems.\nAs in, I always think about all these things as like an interaction between. Atomic actors, and I sort of graph them in my head and try and see all the ways in which they subtly pull on each other, and that sort of thing. I’m interested in any space where I can.\nDo that sort of interrelational analysis. Do you know what I mean? I don’t know if that’s helpful, I think in technical systems, this is obvious because these interactions are explicit And then when it comes to organizational systems, it’s the same for me because there’s all these different instincts that are pulling the self in different directions.\nAnd then you’ve got all these different techniques that interact with each other and have feedback mechanisms. And it’s the same in politics. It’s the same in groups of, how humans choose to group themselves in the world. My Master’s was Interactive Systems Design, and I think it must have been somewhere around the time I did my Master’s that I started to use this as a pattern for interpreting the world at large, and now I just enjoy seeing all sorts of things in the world as some version of these systems.\nSociotechnical systems.\nTris: I didn’t know that was your master’s, that’s very interesting. I wonder if maybe we could summarize our different approaches to things. I wonder if we could summarize our approaches to unpacking these topics as a little more top down and a little more bottom up, where I’m, I look at things very much from the bottom up.\nWould that be a good ? Rule of thumb?\nRobin: I think I do, look at things top down. As in, I see, I think I prefer to draw things down to It’s difficult to say exactly what top down and what bottom up mean. But I think for me, I see things as having certain foundational properties. That then influence the shape of everything around them.\nAnd I’m always trying to draw out those foundational properties so that we can better understand how everything else is oriented by those.\nTris: There is something to be said for the bottom up approach of getting all your ducks in a row, getting all of the data discovered. rather than a top down approach. This was something that I, researched and talked about in my autism video. I’m sure the listeners probably know that I’m autistic.\nYou certainly do. And I think all my friends certainly do. The behavioral patterns that we see in people with autism are varied and sometimes contradictory. But\na very common trait is bottom up thinking. And I got this from the book, Unmasking Autism, by Dr. Devon Price, I highly recommend it, if you haven’t read it already,\nRobin: I haven’t read it.\nTris: Half of my video’s research was inspired by the revelations in that book, I thought I knew everything about my condition, and then, Devon was like, here’s all the things.\nA bottom up approach to life was inspired by, by unmasking autism. Devon was really nice and ruined my life because I was ready to publish, I was gonna do it on Monday. He replied to my inquiry email on Friday saying, Sorry I missed your email, I hardly ever use email.\nYes, I’d be delighted for you to feature my book. Here is a PDF, please don’t share it. I hadn’t based any of my video on any of his work, though I had heard of his book.\nObviously, I’d emailed him. Anyway, I read it over the weekend, and after the first chapter, I was like, oh no, I have to rewrite my entire video because this is so good. The first chapter of information was so amazing. So I rewrote my video on Saturday, and then that Saturday evening, I read chapter two.\nAnd I was like, oh no, I have to rewrite my video again. And so Sunday I rewrote it again, but I’d learned my lesson, I finished the book. And so then over the next two weeks, there was so much more to learn and so much more detail, like, it’s all very well writing about programming, making a video about programming.\nHere’s this cool feature of the language, x, y, z, and you can just look up this information, find it, and it’s good. Even if you can’t find the information online, even if it’s completely novel, you can test out your idea with programming. You can write a program and run it,\nand it’ll either work or it won’t.\nAnd so you’ve got a lot of confidence when writing about\nprogramming, whereas with any mental health condition, absolute nightmare.\nSo this bottom up approach\nreally, really, came from, came from that.\nRobin: Yeah. But I’m not sure that that’s necessarily the same thing as what I’m talking about. I think it’s related\nTris: Oh, yeah,\nRobin: obviously,\nthere’s a lot of overlap\nbetween autism and ADHD but I identify with\nthe ADHD\npart and I don’t think I identify with the Autism side of things, particularly, and I don’t think I particularly identify with the bottom up ness because I think a lot of my structures of\nthinking are also top down.\nTris: That’s a very good way of looking at it. Whereas I am autistic and I cannot see things from the top down. a A blessing and a curse in many ways. Ideally you would use both, which you do a lot better than I. So I’m looking forward to hearing, as we all, as ever when talking to you, I’m looking forward to hearing your take on things, your opinion, or looking forward to the conversation that will bring out a better understanding of the topic\nRobin: Yeah, I can’t help thinking though that’s not, that can’t be a perfect description because in a lot of ways, a bottom up approach that you’re describing sounds like it’s much more decomposed and there’s lots more Pieces that are free floating and mine sounds much more anchored because I’m talking about there being foundational things that lead to everything else, but in the way we actually live our lives, it’s the opposite.\nYou’re much better at having. Structure and, routine and, organizational first principles that you actually adhere to. And I am all over the place and quite unstructured and quite, quite chaotic. I feel like in a way that can’t be the, I think it’s one of those things where like you try and describe it this way, but it’s only looks that way from a particular angle.\nYeah,\nif you looked at it from a different angle, it wouldn’t necessarily take that shape. So yeah.\nTris: I agreed, I was just trying to make something similar, something simple for the listeners. In fact, I think I’ve done you a disservice with it. I’m going to redefine my, my, my rule of thumb, my generalization of us, whereas you do top down and bottom up and I only do bottom up. I think that might be as fairer.\nRobin: This is the thing I’m saying that the assumption that you only do bottom up, wouldn’t explain how good you are at, having clear goals and ethical rules and principles that allow you to be incredibly powerful in how you approach life.\nTris: I think it’s, I suppose these, as you say, top down and bottom up don’t really mean anything until we start to define them. And for me. A, writing a book is a top down goal, whereas the habit of sitting and writing 400 words a day is a bottom up habit. So I see these, the things that I’m good at are because of this.\nbottom up way of thinking. If I do this small, low level action and I craft it well enough, then I can build upon it and eventually get to the top, which is where the goal sits, which is me, say, publishing a book.\nRobin: But for that particular example, I think that’s just objectively the better approach. If you can’t write, you can’t write a book by being like, okay, I’m going to write a book now. You have to do the thing you’re talking about. It’s the only way that works.\nTris: You would not believe how many people think that you can write a book that way, and indeed would recommend sitting and letting the muses take you and when you’re bored, stand up and go outside. And then when the muses take you again, go down and do it. I mean, it’s a perfectly reasonable way to do it if it works for you, but I think that only bottom up things work.\nAnd I, That is because I have only tried bottom up things. It is my, one of my biases is that because I think in autistic way, I have only been able to succeed with autistic thinking and autistic actions and therefore the only things that work for me are autistic ways of doing things, which is very easy for me to decide.\nLook, I made a YouTube channel by doing all of these Bottom up, autistic decisions, or behaviours, or whatever. And I did the same with this, and with that, and whatever. But again, there’s no reason for that. They’ve worked for me, and they might work for others. In fact, I think probably. As you say, a lot of things should be bottom up, but the curse of somebody who has autistic traits is that a lot of things should be top down as well.\nAnd if you can’t access that way of thinking as easily, you’re at a bit of a disadvantage.\nRobin: Yes. Yeah. Fair enough. I’m very interested actually at some point, probably not right now in drawing out how much of those things are much more are common to humans, much more broadly than autism. Because it seems to me that the, what I see in you is a lot of very well refined techniques that you need Because you have a particular need of them, which other people might not need quite so keenly.\nBut nonetheless, they are the, for most people, they are the more efficient approach. That’s my belief when it comes to something like that. If you want to be a writer, you have to write 10, 000 words a day. Not maybe 10, 000, you have to write X number of words a day.\nKeep doing that. You will build up and you will turn into something. That thing that, Wow, that was a great quote I heard. I don’t remember, but it was like something about how, every project, every really impressive goal, achievement that anyone has ever has only looks like a really impressive achievement when viewed from a distance.\nWhen viewed up close, it is a thousand tiny things that on their own are not impressive. And, I think that’s just broadly true. And the idea that, it can be created because you intend because you have this strong commitment to this vision to create this huge thing.\nis basically an illusion in people at large, not just in autistic people. Do you know what I mean? But I don’t know how much that’s true, but that’s where I am at the moment.\nTris: I agree. The one of the, when writing about mental health, like I have done for my ADHD and my autism videos, and I hope I will do more in the future, one of the common concerns, or pieces of feedback, is these behaviours that you’re describing and are saying are either ADHD or autism or, some other label, they’re things, they’re behaviours that humans just can do.\nYou’re not, it’s, you’re not flying, you’re not, walking through walls, you’re not doing things that other people can’t do. But The reason that we categorise them in these umbrellas of behaviours, is if they all happen at the same time, or a lot of them are happening, and they’re happening a lot more than usual, we’ve got, what we’ve got here could be this thing that we name autism, or whatever. Yeah, it’s, I forget what that is exactly called, but in my autism video I called it the constellation of behaviours, like one or two stars, like whatever, who knows what’s going on, but. If you get, a whole cluster of them, they might have a shape you recognise, and then you give that shape a name, and there you go.\nI’m very pleased with that metaphor, for autism. I had a, I came up with it when trying to describe it to my dad. I was just, riffing and trying to explain what autism was to this, gent who definitely had autism. And was telling me that all these behaviours were normal because he’d done them his entire life.\nRobin: Yeah, absolutely. I think it’s a really great description as well. I do really think it’s incredibly important for people Not to when it comes to mental health labels, neurodivergent,\neffectively, for people not to take them as.\nA single thing and a bucket and an obvious, a well defined and inflexible description that you can necessarily know exactly what it is, that it’s always a, a slight, skewing of the very normal human experience and all of the individual behaviors are. Also that and so when there’s a collection of them that together, land together in a particular way and to a particular level, then we can try and give them a label and that’s helpful because it is useful to say, Oh, you’re this kind of thing.\nthing, and I’m also this thing, that’s nice. And that, and there’s lots of ways in which you can then have, target appropriate techniques at people that have that collection of characteristics, but they’re not, they’re not something that’ll, that, that, that means you can strongly separate, and I think that’s in the whole, whole of mental health, that, that is true. And that’s super important. And I think so many of the conditions, like extreme conditions, things that people assume they, they go nowhere near, Schizophrenia, right? Psychopathy. People think that they are, like, a completely different class of a person that is, wholly removed from their experience of the world.\nAnd I think it is at all. I think they’re, certain parts of characteristics that you understand just being pushed to, just being more extreme in that person than in you, right? And the way you put it, I think is brilliant.\nTris: Thank you so much.\n[01:07:42] How often?\nTris: robin? How often are we going to record? How often should a podcast like this Be published.\nRobin: I, I’d like to say, show me that it matters,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: because I have podcasts that, Publish multiple times a week that I listen to and podcasts that publish once or twice a month. And I would love it if the ones that publish once or twice a month published more often, but I’ve never considered not listening to them just because they publish infrequently.\nTris: I agree. I’m of the same mind. Although I don’t believe I subscribe to anything that is more often than a week, mostly because I don’t tend to listen to a lot of non fiction. I only listen to perhaps, two or three, three or four. Most of my listening is fiction, sci fi or fantasy or something like that.\nRobin: I think maybe to start with, we should aim for monthly. Because I think to start with, it’s going to be very inefficient. You’re the one that I seems to have mostly taken on the burden of actually trying to cut all our ramblings down into something interesting and palatable.\nAnd I think that, that sounds like a really daunting and mammoth task, and I certainly wouldn’t want to put you under any pressure to do that any quicker than it, than it takes. I think maybe we can target fortnightly as like a pipe dream. If we get all our processes really efficient and we get really practiced at recording, usable stuff most of the time, then I think.\nThen I think fortnightly might be realistic, but I would say to start with, let’s not assume that we can do anything quicker than a month.\nTris: Yes, I would rather have a very high quality thing once a month than something more, reactionary or less well put together, thought out, researched, something like that.\nRobin: Okay, we’ll aim to publish monthly, although I don’t think the monthly is a strict requirement. We’ll do it when it’s ready,\nTris: Hmm. I think that is fair. I should perhaps contrast with some existing schedules that I have in my life. So Lost Terminal, my science fiction. Podcast comes out every week, comes out on Monday, and because that is just me, it’s quite manageable. I’m not beholden to an editor, I’m not beholden to a collaborator, like there’s no adverts, it’s just me putting out 15 minutes of fiction every week.\nSo that’s how I can do it every week. The Phosphene catalog comes out every two weeks. Season 2 is hopefully going to be coming out on Halloween. And that is mostly pre recorded. I record with our mutual friend Wolfie, and, though that requires a bit more editing and perhaps a little more pickups and so forth, two weeks works very well there.\nModem Prometheus comes out every full moon, which is a nightmare because the moon drifts through the month and occasionally collides with other things like the weekly and fortnightly projects. And no boilerplate is, Monthly ish, since RSI, I’ve relaxed a little bit about it, but I certainly, I’m hoping to have one in August.\nRobin: It used, when it first started, it felt, it was probably more like fortnightly, wasn’t it?\nTris: As soon as that first video, that first Rust video blew up and ruined my email inbox with a thousand comments overnight, I was like, okay, what do I need, what can I do here? I need to make another video, and so I said, right, I’ll do it every two weeks.\nAnd then I have the classic YouTuber burnout. And now I do it about every month, but it’s movable feast, so it’s approximately every month, but I don’t hurt myself trying to publish on a certain day, not knowing in advance what could be happening that week.\nRobin: And have you got any impression that the different publishing schedules between those different productions makes any difference? Has any impact on? The audience.\nTris: They might not, you know. The audience, I think, were you to ask them. Your listeners, your viewers. They would always want more. That’s perfectly reasonable. I want, I would like to watch more of the things that I like as well. So they can’t be trusted to ask that question. And I don’t think, people didn’t unsubscribe when I went down from every two weeks to, every month.\nThings have been going from strength to strength. In fact, I think the quality of my output Has been getting higher and I now do longer videos like my ADHD video was 19 minutes long. It nearly killed me but I was able to do that. I couldn’t have done that in just a quick two week turnaround.\nRobin: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I think that a month is enough. I suppose the danger would be if it felt like it had dried up, right? If somebody thought, Oh, I don’t even know if this person’s like publishing anymore. That would then be bad. Then you’d probably lose subscribers.\nBut I think as long as you’re clearly still pushing content out.\nTris: Yes, uh, and typically a lot of podcatchers, which is what a podcast client is called, they tend to have like an automated little badge when you’re looking down, perhaps in search results or in the main page of a feed, they’ll say that the title, the author, a little description, you know, whatever, the logo, but also the podcatcher itself might how regular the podcast is.\nRobin: Okay, I don’t think we want to have a really strict schedule. We want to try and release it when it’s ready. But I think we do also want to try and make it regular ish. So we don’t want like the next gap to be more than like 50 to 150 percent of the previous gap.\nTris: Yes, I think we could aim for monthly, with a date that we commit to, at the very least in private, between\nourselves.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. Cool. Okay. That sounds good to me.\n[01:13:14] Conclusion\nTris: I’m having a really great time, as I always do, chatting with you, Robin. And thank you very much for your time here. This sort of discussion of tech and art and that sort of thing\nI wouldn’t usually talk about this sort of thing, day to day. Usually I would, stay in my house all day, every day, just writing, and producing and, being a digital hermit.\nSo it’s a great pleasure.\nRobin: I’m really enjoying it too. I’ve always wanted to, have more of these sorts of discussions. And, there’s very little opportunity in, normal life. So thank you so much for, suggesting the podcast. And I think it’s, I think it’s going well. I really enjoyed it.\nTris: Pleasure. Pleasure. I will talk to you next\nweek. We’ll do some more taping. And I suppose our listeners will hear from us. In a month.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/1/","title":"On Writing & Mental Health"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/2/":{"body":"\n\nWe discuss our experiences with conferences pre and post-pandemic, the psychological hurdles of public speaking, and our evolving use of Obsidian for personal knowledge management (PKM).\n\n📖 CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 Overcoming the Fear of Public Speaking\n11:40 I LIKE TRAINS\n13:15 Exploring the Rust Programming Language\n20:15 Obsidian Daily Note System and Priority Tasks\n32:45 Using Spaced Repetition for Capture\n46:15 Morning Routine and Habit Formation\n\n🔗 LINKS\nOurs\n\nhttps://robinwinslow.uk\nhttps://noboilerplate.org\nhttps://lostterminal.com\nhttps://modemprometheus.com\nhttps://phosphenecatalogue.com\n\nExternal\n\nA System For Writing - Bob Doto\nClojure: Turtles All The Way Down\nRust: Turtles All The Way Down\nFasterthanli.me\nObsidian.md\n\n🧑 CREDITS\nDecapsulate is a NAMTAO Production (namtao.com)\nIt is hosted by:\n\nTristram Oaten (https://mastodon.social/@0atman)\nRobin Winslow (https://union.place/@nottrobin)\n\nThis work is BrainMade (https://brainmade.org)\nTranscript\nDC2\n[00:00:00]\nTristram: A month ago I went to my first conference in five years. I think.\nRobin: Wow. Tell me about it.\nTristram: I used to go to conferences all the time before the pandemic. Before the pandemic started and I realized that I had lost the, lost the habit I’d, up until that point, I’d pushed myself very, very hard to, into public speaking positions.\nWhenever there was something at work that needed a presentation or if there was a, like a, a club at work where people would bring little presentations and talk about things that they liked, I would force myself to do them because at one point I was really, really scared and terrified of doing them\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: sort of exposure\nRobin: Uh, and\nTristram: and,\nRobin: is it?\nTristram: throughout my working life, I’ve tried to do these whenever there’s an in-person thing.\nand it started out small in just volunteering for like doing a presentation on the work we were doing something like that. But by the end of the 2010s, I was speaking at closure conferences, specifically closure X in London, the first time I just had a, lightning talk in my back pocket.\nAnd the next year I actually wrote a specific talk for. Closure X closure, by the way, perhaps some of our listeners might not know, um, is a lisp programming language. It’s the one with all the ens. Uh, it’s based on, based on Java. It’s the cool one if there is such a thing as a cool lisp.\nBut, uh,\nRobin: people say people that use it. Yes.\nTristram: yes. Right, exactly of the lisps, it’s of, it’s, it’s perhaps the coolest.\nthe first talk I did at closure X, I actually repurposed into one of my rust videos, one of my very early rust videos. Um, the first slide is, have I got a deal for you?\nAnd it was about how great closure is. Um, because Rust and Lisp were so similar in many regards, I was able to reuse much of that into a, a rust talk.\nRobin: you’re at risk of exposing your, your, your patterns. I mean, you’re like, you know, closure. Wonderful. The best thing in the world, everyone should use it. Rust. Wonderful. Best thing. What should you said?\nTristram: Right. I mean, I, if if tomorrow I find a new language that’s better than rust, I will start talking about that. There’s just been nothing, nothing left. Oh, I, I had to look it up ’cause I’ve, I, it’s seven years ago, um, turtles all the way down was my closure video. And then\nRobin: that.\nTristram: years ago, right. I rewrote it into rust turtles all the way, all the way down.\n’cause really I’m talking about like the, the macro system and how you can like build, build on the language without anyone’s asking permission. Without asking permission from anyone,\nRobin: saying is it’s really nice to have something that’s sort of written in its own language, I guess a whole system. language, basically it’s like, you know, you can, you can create the pieces, the fundamental bounding building blocks, and then you can build up on them and it’s all within the same, um, the same syntax.\nTristram: right? Yes, exactly. Like the, the way the way you write a python stack is you build very fast plumbing in sea and then you call those modules from Python. And that, that gets, that’s, that’s quite a good way of doing things really. It’s a good separation of concerns, but it comes with drawbacks. Um, I won’t, I won’t rehash the, the turtles, um, analogy.\nSo I, but I was doing all of this before 20, before 2020. And then either the pandemic or maybe just becoming somebody who does online things professionally, like I just fell out of the habit of. Going to conferences, like I’d worked so hard for 15 years to develop this. I suppose now that I’m saying this out loud, maybe my, maybe my itch had been scratched by doing the videos on YouTube, so I, it\nRobin: I, can I just, um, um, I\nTristram: it’s, please,\nRobin: like I think most all, I don’t know if I’ve ever been to a conference that I organize my, like as in that I, that I did independently from work. So for me, the reason why it dropped off if I were, you would absolutely be, because I no longer had an employer to like, to get, to get me to go to conferences.\nRight.\nTristram: Yeah. I mean, I, yeah, that is interesting. Like you’re no longer sort of in the, in the zone surrounded by people who are talking about the conferences that they’re going to.\nRobin: Well, and\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: you\nTristram: That,\nRobin: probably like a budget and a, you know, there’s, there’s some pressure and there’s, and there’s people from your company that won’t go to the same conference and that sort of thing, you know?\nTristram: Hmm. Yeah, that’s true. Yeah. I hadn’t thought of, and there’s, there’s probably a lot of small, you know, little, little reasons, but I, the big reason that I wanna bring up in quite a very personal way is that I think I was like becoming a shut away introvert more than I already am. This presumably didn’t happen to you as much because you were still working with other people, talking to other people even virtually. Um, whereas I’d cut all of that off and my days, which I’m very pleased with, it’s a great privilege, are spent quietly working on the things I want to do, not talking on Slack and in Zoom meetings, which was fricking dream.\nLovely.\nRobin: [00:05:00] I mean, I think you are actually kind of more comfortable with that. I feel like you are, you are, you are better at both ends than me in that you seem both. Even, even back then, I think you seemed certainly better than me at, um, deciding to create events. You were going to things like um, other,\nTristram: Hmm\nRobin: you know, and, and so you’d always have schedules.\nYou’d always have scheduled stuff, and had this ability to sit for a morning and, work on a thing. And I feel like I’ve become increasingly worth worse at both. And I think that it, the pandemic has played a huge role. Um, like\nTristram: hmm.\nRobin: I was working, but I was working remotely. And my work, which became a hundred percent remote after pandemic or during pandemic and then afterwards. And, um, and it, and it was very difficult to come out of. And, um, I, I’ve been to one conference since the Pandemic and that was, uh, um, lead, is it called Lead Dev? Um, yeah. Um,\nTristram: Well, oh yeah, I think I’ve heard of that one.\nRobin: Um, and, and it was great. It was, it was wonderful and it, but it was with my, it was with my new company. Um, I can’t go this year ’cause I’m, oh, I couldn’t go this year, I think.\n’cause it would, yeah, I think it, it clashed with a important thing. I dunno. but yeah, like I,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: I feel similar to you. Like I did have a rhythm of going to conferences and I haven’t stopped working. Like, to me, it doesn’t coincide with a massive change in my, in my working patterns, but, um, but I, but it does, it does more coincide with having my second child, so,\nTristram: That’ll do it.\nRobin: yeah. That’ll do it. Um, yeah. But, but I, I also definitely went through the same sort of pattern.\nTristram: So it was a huge surprise to me that this suddenly was on my radar. I, I wasn’t speaking or anything, I was just there as a, a, a participant, um, a, an audience member. Um, and I, and it was super last minute. I was doing some audio work for. Um, Amos from Faster Than Lime. Um, I don’t know if, if I have spoken to you particularly about, um, about this, but this is another, this is a fellow YouTuber.\nI feel like we’re all colleagues on YouTube because we, we don’t, we’re not competing with each other. If someone watches one of my videos, they’ll go over to a faster in line video afterwards if I’m, if I’m doing my algorithm right. Um, I compliment myself enormously by assuming that, um, and this is the, this is the, the person who my second rust video, I asked if I could borrow one of their blog posts to just kind of make into a video.\n’cause I had no idea what I was doing. Maybe my third video, maybe, maybe the second one, I, I was Okay. Uh, rust in 10 minutes is, is the, is based on Amos’s, um, Amos’s Post. Anyway, so we’ve all always been in the same circle and, um, we have become, uh, professional and, uh, personal associates. Um, that’s a weird way of saying friends.\nWe have become friends and, uh, I’ve, I’ve moved them from one, uh, category to another in my mental database. And, um, and as our listeners probably will now know that though, the project that I was recording is, uh, amos’s videos now contain, uh, a cutaways or added dialogue by a character called Cool Bear.\nAnd that’s me voiced by me. Amos has always had them in the blog posts. They’re these little inline cutaways that where the cool bear says, Hey, what’s with this code block? Why does it look like that? And, and that allows a very interesting narrative. Is it socra? Is it, is it a socra dialogue where you ask questions and then immediately answer them?\nRobin: I think is where you tell you make a point through the, through the mechanism of having a sort of master and a student. Um, conversation. I, I\nTristram: Right. Got it. Okay. Yes, exactly. Um, okay, good. So something like that except that it’s, it’s two masters perhaps talking to each other or they, they switch roles. And so it was really fun to record this, this character. ’cause it’s very definitely a character. Um, I, I tried to do a, uh, a certain voice. Um, leaning really into my, my British, uh, my British accent to, uh, to make it even funnier.\nUm, and, and it’s really, it’s been very, very good. Anyway, am and I were doing this recording, and at the end of it, as we were chatting, Amal said, are you going to Ure next week? Um, and I was like, no, I’d love to. Uh, why do you ask? And I didn’t even know there was a conference going on because I, they’d just fallen off my radar.\nI remember like in 2022 or 2021, I was thinking, oh, I should go to these rust conferences, you know, I’m a rust trooper. Um, and then I just forgot about that and just like, like, it just just left my brain. So I, get tickets with one week to go, six days to go, I think. And, suddenly I’ve got this ticket and I’m like, oh, no. so I check the hotels. They’re 300 euros a night.\nOh my God. I check the flights. They’re not, they’re not great. And I also don’t like flying, but I check the train. Train is affordable. Like it was, it was really [00:10:00] expensive because of how late everything was. But I don’t regret it for a second. whatever, no boilerplate budget I have should be spent on this sort of thing.\nThis is exactly the sort of thing that I. But do more like, it’s a like, spoiler. I had a great time. So I took the train. It’s always lovely leaving England by train I wonder if our, um, the people in our audience might, might not know this, but we have exactly one high speed rail system, one high speeded rail section in all of the uk and it’s from London to the ocean.\nIt gets you outta the uk. You can leave really quickly.\nRobin: Yeah, that’s the fastest bit because it has to interface with the European rail, which is better than the UK rail. And so we had to do a European grade that bit.\nTristram: Yes, exactly. If,\nRobin: which is quite funny. Um, but I wanted to just, just, um, step back, a half step.\nTristram: Hmm,\nRobin: Um,\nTristram: yes.\nRobin: you were saying you wanted to use, you know, if you had no boilerplate budget, this is what you’d use it for.\nPresumably you mean by that, that you think that? What you got out of this conference was, um, was like particularly good, like supportive of the No right project. Is that right?\nTristram: Absolutely. It was, it was wildly, wildly good. Like I, I, I suppose some people might, you know, maybe, maybe some, some companies or YouTubers or whatever might do advertising. Like there, there’s a lot of commercial stuff as there is with any, any conference. But I don’t think I, I want or need to do that. What I got out of it was inspiration.\nRobin: right.\nTristram: Like, it was so, so good to see all these incredible programmers, like absolute ninjas. Like there was a, a teenager hacking on the Linux kernel and like telling us all about it. Like this is, this is so inspiring to see all these, all these cool people in our, uh, rust community. Uh, it was so inspiring that on the train home, the train is four hours from London to Amsterdam.\nUh, on the train home. I just wrote another video and then published it a week later. Like, I’d on, on the way there, I just published my writing is thinking video or writing at the speed of thought. I think that is the title. And I wanted to get that published just, just before the, the conference, just to make sure that people remembered who I was.\nUh, it’d been, it’d been over a month since I’d, since I’d done everything. I’m slowing down my, my schedule as the videos get like more complex, which is good and bad. I’d like, I’d like to do like small videos and long videos just to keep things fresh.\nRobin: just\nTristram: And that took me.\nRobin: every other day. And then I said in the background, you’re, you’re doing your like\nTristram: Oh God. Well, that’s what I’m doing. I, I’ve, I’m finding that I’ve got these smaller videos in that I’m just, I’m pushing out. But in the background, there’s the big projects. Like at the moment I’ve got a video that the draft title is a system for thinking, a system for thinking. I think, I think that is what I’m gonna go for.\nUm, and it’s a big, big topic. Perhaps we will speak about it, uh, later on, like a obsidian task management, PKM EGAs and loads of stuff. And it’s a big topic. The video that I’m pushing out, hopefully next week or the week after, is on async programming in Rust. A much more straightforward topic, at least in terms of, uh, deep creativity required.\nIt’s more of a, it’s more of an explainer. It’s more of an opinion video. And it’s nice. It’s a nice, tight, tight turnaround. The video I made, the video I wrote on the train back to London was, um, my last video, which is just oxidize your CLI number two, like it’s a, a carry on video from a a, it’s a carryover video that’s not what we call it, a sequel, that’s what we call them.\nIt’s a sequel to a video I made a couple of years ago with like, Hey, what tools can you replace with rust? And it’s way, way more impressive now. Like you can replace the entire user land of, uh, of your Linux machine. Like, like the head. Program like tail, uh, gr like all of these gu new tools are just, have been rewritten in Rust And Ubuntu is, has got an optional like switch for the, did you see this, the canonical pushed out a, a very simple one line, uh, one-line change where you can swap out your user land tools with the rust version.\nDid you see that?\nRobin: I ha I basically haven’t used Ubuntu, um, I, since that Canonical, maybe not quite, maybe, maybe since I started my new job. But I, I know, I mean, I’m so far from, from knowing that level of detail on what’s going on in, in Ubuntu\nTristram: Ah, it was, that was, there was some hand wring involved, you know, because you’ve got the canoe tools. They’re like, you know, decades and decades of, of, of slow iteration. They’re extremely stable. There’s 600 or so unit tests for the whole suite. And then you’ve got this upstart rust project that in the space of a year or two has, is, is now, I think 550 of those 600 acceptance tests for the canoe tools are passing in the rust version.\nAnd there’s still plenty of work to be done. Um, but I just switched my whole user land to them on my Nix OS system and I’ve just not noticed any difference. Like, everything’s working fine. Like all of [00:15:00] the, uh, maybe I, I think that they, they were very optimized before. Um, like rust is fast, but it’s like, it, it’s, it’s as fast as see.\nRobin: I mean, um, you know, like I use RIP Grab, right? RIP GRP is way faster than gr obviously it’s got a slightly\nTristram: Yes,\nRobin: Maybe I’m missing some key difference in the actual feature set, but. But like, are there not similar speed improvements that can be made simply, not necessarily because it’s written in rust, but simply by starting from the ground up with your, with, with how you’re actually solving the problem, maybe?\nTristram: I, I bet there are, and the biggest one is rusts, fearless concurrency. Like it’s, you have to be extremely cautious and careful, and you have to know what you’re doing to write concurrent and parallel programs in C and it requires a lot of thorough testing and it, it’s extremely, uh, it’s extremely challenging.\nWhereas in rust, it’s trivial. So a big speed increase is that there would’ve been, I, I, I’m guessing, but I, I think I, I have a good idea. You can, you can get loads of low hanging fruit that the seed developers just didn’t wanna touch. Like, you could make these five threads, you could make this, this little inner loop here.\nYou could paralyze it if only you wanted to. And in certain circumstances, you don’t want to, uh, you don’t, it’s not that you can’t do it in c it’s that the initial reaction is, oh, I be, I better not, or maybe I’ll do that later. You know, like, that’s some future, you know.\nRobin: like makes absolutely, makes, makes that difference in a huge, but, but, but you, it sounds like\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: saying that that efficiency, that speed of be, of doing these difficult things, like in c they can be done and they are done and they lead to very efficient programs, but it takes a long time because you are carefully considering it, designing it, then you’re testing it really thoroughly, et cetera in rust\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: they’ve got some core mechanisms that mean that the testing, like it’s not so brittle.\nIt’s not so dangerous. Um,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: but, but, but that’s, but that’s not so much led to a suite of much more performant tools. Instead it’s, it’s led to very, very quick meeting of the same standard, if you know what I mean. That’s what it sounds like.\nTristram: Yes, exactly. Yes. Right, exactly. There’s, and there’s, it’s exactly the same happened with the, with the, uh, Linux on Arm project, or rather the Linux on Mac project. Um, like Sahi, Lena wrote the GPU driver for the MacBook in like 10 weeks because she wrote it in, in rust. Like, you get a huge speed up because you’re not firefighting all of the time.\nYou know, it’s quite straightforward what I, what I say in my videos. I think bears repeating these things are possible in other languages, but in rust they very easy like that. That is a very, very big level up. Like it, it.\nRobin: the, the mind fuck of rust.\nTristram: Yes, the, uh, the, the, the, the bo checker, there’s one, there’s one, one thing to understand. Yeah, exactly. And I, and I suppose that the type system, but like, if you can understand Garvin’s type system, you can understand rust. It’s, it’s just a bit more complicated,\nRobin: the borrow\nTristram: so.\nRobin: referring to. Yeah. I haven’t, I\nTristram: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. That, that’s, that’s ’cause you’ve, you’ve not, you’ve not watched my video on the borrowed checker.\nLike, it’s so trivial. It’s just, it’s it’s in no other,\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: it’s in, it’s in no other language. That’s the thing. The, the, the, the bo checker says that you, you can have a, you have as many read-only references to a variable as you like.\nRobin: on your story.\nTristram: Oh, right. All right, all right.\nRobin: a,\nTristram: Right.\nRobin: a, a episode about you teaching me rust, we can, but let’s, let’s do it. That’s a, that’s a\nTristram: I’m making a note. Future episode, teach Robin Rust live on, on air. Okay. So the, the second problem with rewriting everything, the goo tools in rust, I think probably is this, uh, is this suite of, of acceptance tests, the unit tests, the canoe acceptance tests. Probably you can break acceptance tests with parallelism or with concurrency.\nLike the tests might, might not be written, assuming that it’s going to be parallel or parallelizable. Uh, so I bet, I bet there are some places where they can’t do it because the goal is 100% future parity and then perhaps improvement.\nRobin: Mm. Yep, yep. No, that makes sense.\nTristram: So,\nRobin: Um,\nTristram: I dunno why, why I talked about this.\nRobin: you were talking about the Rust Conference. Um, I’m not quite sure what got us onto that detail of rust.\nTristram: It’s ’cause I, on, on the way back, on the train back, I was so inspired by the conference that I, I just like the, the, the words flowed outta my fingers onto the keyboard. And I just wrote for four hours continuously and had another video ready to go by the time I got home. It was just, it was wonderful. So an inspiration, I think.\nRobin: that experience, I would suggest the train ride as is important of a, of an element of it as the conferences, because I completely agree with you.\nTristram: Ah,\nRobin: every conference, my brain is exploding, but I don’t normally have a four hour train, train, ride to then, you know, do nothing but write\nTristram: right,\nRobin: Um, which would probably be quite, you know, it’s quite a good mechanism.\nTristram: it sure is my plan for this coming weekend. Uh, I’m going back down to, uh, see my parents, which is another four hour train ride. Um, and uh, so I, my plan is like [00:20:00] I’ll finish the current video that I’m working on the script in that train ride. Uh, I agree love, love a train ride, bad wifi or bad 4G plus.\nNothing really to do that’s good for productivity.\nRobin: mean that\nTristram: So,\nRobin: awesome. Like I’m quite jealous.\nTristram: So I mentioned very briefly when we were talking about the conference that I have a lot to say about obsidian. PKM Zettelkasten, so forth.\nRobin: You said you’ve got an upcoming video.\nTristram: Uh, yeah, I do. Yes. The, uh, system for thinking, uh, it’s related to my previous video, you know, how, how to write at the speed of thought, like it, it’s all going around in my brain and like there’s this big idea that I, that I’m working on and small videos, small ideas are kind of falling out of it almost as a side effect, but it’s not the main, the main idea.\nThe main idea is this system for System for Thinking video. Uh, the title I’m sure you’ll recognize is, um, base. The title is Inspired by a System for writing a book by Bob Dotto. I’ll make sure that the, the link is in the show notes, um, which is a recent discovery of mine and I think is the best book on the Zettelkasten method.\nI think I recommended it to you.\nRobin: I think I’ve, um, if it’s the one you recommended, which I admit I don’t remember the title of, then I, you know, I mean, I read probably a third or a bit more. Um,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: think I was, you know, it’s like I had a plane ride, right? Um, a plane ride. Do you call it a\nTristram: Uh\nRobin: Do you ride a plane or\nTristram: oh Yeah. You don’t, I don’t, you don’t ride a plane, do you? A flight.\nRobin: I had a\nTristram: You had a flight. Oh,\nRobin: It’s,\nTristram: fun,\nRobin: shorter\nTristram: fun.\nRobin: it, isn’t it? I had a flight and, um, I spent most of the flight reading the book, and then I think I might have had even like a train ride afterwards or something. And I was reading the book then and I was taking notes and all this sort of thing. Um, but it certainly hasn’t flowed into, I mean, I suppose, I suppose my impression of it from the book, which I didn’t finish, um, only got as far as it helped me like it, like ever so slightly augmented my use of obsidian, like for general note keeping, but I, but I certainly am not following like a, um, unification, general unification system of, of like thought, um. In my, in my obsidian use so far.\nTristram: A Grand unified theory.\nRobin: exactly\nTristram: Tell me about your, uh, of city news.\nRobin: right. Yeah. Well, um, so it’s, it’s always been a bit, I don’t think I’m a person who can, like I’ve seen how you use obsidian and I feel like you, like yours is like a world building experience. Like you, you’ve got different colors for different parts of the day. You’ve given, you’ve, you’ve named like areas, um, rooms, um, within your schedule, like, you know, the library where you’re gonna do your reading and, and this kind of thing.\nSo, so it’s like, so when\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: it, it’s like you’re inhabiting a world that you’ve built and that I think makes it so much more, um, tangible for you. And it also means that you, that that, because it’s a whole project that you know, and, and, and a significant and and impressive looking project, um, it makes it easier for you to then like to really care about refining it, I think, and making sure that it’s, um, tidy right now. I doubt I am able to do that. I think I tend to have too many parallel things that I care about in my mind at any given time. And my use of obsidian is like, I’ll only use it and this is also kinda the way I work, but I’ll only use it, um, where I think I can do something quick that doesn’t have to be perfect and it nonetheless adds something. So I use the Daily Notes\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: for a while. I tried using weekly notes and I rejected that. So I use the Daily Notes system and I’ve got it so that I’ve set up a little template so that every time I create a new note, it links back to Daily Notes System. It’s got a little set of, you know, standard front matter. I’ve got some categories in there. Um, but it’s like the whole thing is set up with the understanding that the, all, every one of the systems I’m using are gonna have massive number of loose ends, right? Fundamentally, it’s a place for\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: throw information in such a way that if I came back and wanted to find it again, hopefully I could, right? Um, more or less that. So then I, I, I write down tasks I want to complete in future. In there I start new project documents, which I may or may not return to. And I use the system in my daily note, um, of like having, I link through to what I think I call, um, like, I dunno, important documents or something, or, I can’t remember what the word I use is. Um, but\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: a lot of, so, so, so a lot of it is like, I’ve only got a collection of about six documents that I consider to be high enough importance that they’re there in my face for every daily note. And that includes my priority tasks document, which I will throw stuff into when I think it’s an important task.\nBut I’ve never, ever managed to have the habit. Of, of like being like, oh, okay, I’ve got some space now I’m gonna go and look at my task list. I’m gonna start at the top. Like that never happens. Sometimes I’ve accidentally done one of them because they came back around in my mind and, and I cared about them, but I never, never ever followed the tasks from the [00:25:00] top. Um, so yeah, so, so my use of, and I keep a journal in there and stuff, and it’s all linked up, but, but my use of obsidian is like that. Like it’s, it’s lots of different patchworky things that I cobble all together and it, and it helps me that they’re all in one place. Um, but any, um, any, any serious structure or any serious routine, um, that’s well kept to, is an emergent property of me using obsidian rather than designed, if that makes sense.\nTristram: It does, it does. And I, I struggle with this as well. Um, I, I think the, I, I recognize everything that you are talking about, and this is where I was five years ago when I started using obsidian. Um, it, it, it, it was, it, these things don’t like it. It doesn’t just come naturally. It certainly didn’t with me.\nAnd it sounds like it’s not, not with you either. And I think that’s okay. And I think that’s like, I wanna reassure you, and maybe, maybe I reassure, reassure our listeners that this, this is, this is not something that comes so quickly and like my extremely complex use of obsidian running 80 plugins is not something that I, that happened at the start.\nIn fact, in the first year I stopped and started using obsidian all the time. Like I bounced off it. Like I, it didn’t, I thought it didn’t fit my brain and I went back to, to doist or org mode or, or whatever I was using at the time. And, but I kept coming back to it because there’s something, there’s something there.\nThere’s something in the app\nRobin: I,\nTristram: and in\nRobin: I\nTristram: Yeah,\nRobin: I’m a step beyond that, right? Because. Obsidian is\nTristram: of course.\nRobin: default place to keep information. I have it on my phone, I have it on my computer. I know how to put stuff in there, and I would have confidence that I know where it is, right? Like it’s not like I’m still in the phase of like, I’m half using obsidian, but I’m still not sure whether it, whether it’s whether it’s for me.\nAnd so I’m half using this other\nTristram: Great.\nRobin: I am using obsidian\nTristram: Hmm, hmm.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: Great. Uh, Avi then, so you’re, you’re sort of a year or two into, into it. Just as I was a year or two into it. And I still to this day have this problem of like the divine self and the mundane self, like constantly fighting like I imagine tomorrow that I’m gonna be super organized, that I’m definitely gonna follow this whole checklist that I’ve made and then tomorrow comes and the plan goes out the window.\nBut I feel like the exercise of doing it and, and trying to make the plan and trying to follow the plan every month or year even, it’s a very slow thing. The, the ship slowly moves a degree to the right. You know, I’m, I’m, I’m getting better slowly.\nRobin: Well that’s my experience as well. Yeah.\nTristram: I, and I, I’ve, I, there’s a, there’s a metaphor that I thought of recently ’cause I’m writing the system for thinking video and I, I hope it is useful. The, the, the best, uh, the best. I, hmm. What am I trying to say here? The metaphor is that you are, you are trying to throw a ball forward in time to yourself tomorrow and.\nYou want your future self to catch the pool and carry on doing the thing that you’re hoping, or maybe it’s like a relay, you’re passing the relay bat on through time and you are, you’re hoping that the, your yourself tomorrow will pick it up and carry on running, you know, carry on\nRobin: metaphor\nTristram: race.\nRobin: it’s, I think it’s really good because, because the relay, I feel like it’s\nTristram: Yeah,\nRobin: inevitable in the metaphor that it’s gonna happen. it might happen, it’s not,\nTristram: yeah.\nRobin: as it should because then you, then you’ll lose to your, to your opponents.\nBut, but it’ll happen. Like it’s not her passing a bat on, it’s not difficult. Whereas catching a ball\nTristram: Right.\nRobin: potentially difficult.\nTristram: Okay, good. That, that, the catch ball metaphor is the one that I’ve got, and I second guessed it when explaining it to you because you can drop the ball, you know, like you, you so forth. So there are two, there are two parts of this, this equation. And they, you, you’ve gotta have a lot of trust in both.\nSo the first one is that you’ve got to be able to capture things you want to do in the future, but you can’t do them yet. And that’s the capture side. Like in GTD it’s called the inbox in settle gas and it’s called fleeting notes and all kinds of stuff. Very similar stuff. It’s just like, write down the thing you want and trust that you are going to put it somewhere where your future self will at least look at it.\nThey will at least see it. That, that, no, you make this half of the equation makes no assumption that they will do anything with that, but at least your future self will see it. It’s on the calendar, it’s in the task list, it’s an email notification.\nRobin: about, I schedule as calorie events now, like I was explaining,\nTristram: Right. Okay. Yeah, exactly. Because you, you don’t trust that this system will put it in front of the eyes of your future self, and that does slowly improve over time. The second half of the system is tomorrow’s self. Your, your future mundane, profane, whatever it’s called, the the problem self. That guy in the future who’s not gonna do what you want.\nRobin: The bastard.\nTristram: Um, we all have Yeah, I know. Always ruining like, he’s spending all of my money. Wait, no. Am I spending his money? I forget how it goes. So the, it’s important, it’s important that, so they’ve, they’ve, they’ve gotta catch the ball and then carry on doing, doing the [00:30:00] thing that you want. So you need to have a system that not just stores the notes in carefully that you are sure, yes, this is categorized, right?\nOr I’ve, I’ve, I’ve captured this. Wonderful. Then you have to be able to pass it over to your future self and it has to be surfaced. For me, this is quite a recent thing. I’ve got a combination of two techniques that seem to be working very well, and these are, this is definitely gonna be something that’s part of the video.\nI take fleeting notes, which are just new notes in obsidian with a, a reasonable title. Like, you know, buy the milk, go out and get this call, Robin, what have you. Anything like that. Anything that comes to mind. And I put that into the system with a tag fleeting. And then I. My job is done, the inbox has been satisfied and I’m confident that it’s out of my brain and I can trust the system to work because it does.\nThe next day, every day when I sit down to do my morning writing, I start with one hour of admin. I can’t just start writing Lost terminal or no boilerplate straight away. Like I have to sort of get into it. And a way that I have found, I used to get into things by just like browsing the internet. Like we all like, like, like we all used to, you know, maybe I check my feet or check imager or check my email, whatever.\nAnd that is very dangerous because it can take you down a rabbit hole. And then half the time I wasn’t writing when I should be\nRobin: more than, much\nTristram: an hour or two had passed. Right? Yes, exactly. And, but what I found is that admin, specifically obsidian admin and making sure my inbox, my obsidian inbox of fleeting notes is like processed and I can optimize the process a little bit to do some tweaks, you know, like stuff like that to make it enjoyable.\nAllowing myself to do that has been really good because I guarantee I’ve guaranteed to myself that tomorrow, the tomorrow tri is going to read every single fleeting note I write today. And not just that, but the way that I read these fleeting notes, I’m very proud of. I used, I use s uh. To solve the problem, uh, that Bob talks about in, uh, a system for writing the Ze Carsten book that I, I recommended.\nAnd you have, you have read, in fact, if you’ve read the first third, you have read this, he describes some fleeting notes. Can’t be actioned. And so they must be, they must have a different category for like snoozing them. He calls them sleeping, sleeping fleeting nights. And every now and then you go through that list and go, oh, can I, can I do any of these?\nAre any of these relevant yet sleeping? And I started off just doing that, tagging them, fleeting sleeping. But then it begs the question, well, how do you know when to come back to them? And this system, it already exists and is called spaced repetition. It’s usually used as I’m sure you and our listeners know for language learning or knowledge learning.\nThese are flashcards, anky, uh, Duolingo, the, these, these are all space repetition systems, but I use it for fleeting notes. So when I drop a fleeting note into my system over the course of the day, the next day I cram, uh, in the express, in the, the terminology of, of space repetition. I cram all of my fleeting notes.\nAnd so I see every single one of my new ones, and then I decide on each of them, if I’m going to just do them. Or like get ’em out the way or send that email or whatever, or put them into a, to do or schedule them on the calendar for today. Like, something, something has to happen. And if I don’t do that, or I don’t want to do it today, ’cause it’s not super urgent, I just say I, I just, I just tell the, the space repetition system that, uh, I’ve, I’ve studied this and this was hard.\nRemind me of this again tomorrow.\nRobin: Oh, okay.\nTristram: Uh, which is what, uh,\nRobin: you are\nTristram: we,\nRobin: a difficulty metric out of how it’s like, it’s like things that are written but is hard necessarily. Right? So the thing, the thoughts that I’m having while you are saying this, is that one of\nTristram: yeah.\nRobin: problems I think with, um, my task, you know, my, my task setting for myself in general\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: that I think of so many things like, like so many more things I could be doing that I never have time to do.\nSo it’s a, it is a version of\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: you know, when you’re working in a, in a software team. The backlog is infinite, right? The backlog is always gonna be longer than whatever you might have time for. So you need to have good prioritization because you\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: sure you’re doing the things at the top. And\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: what I really like about, I really like what you are saying in the sense that like, um, you are, you are, you’re sort of skimming, skimming this long list so that you are refreshing your mind. So you’re keeping it like available to you. And then, and then you have the complete freedom to like, to like, choose the things that jump out within it to say like, oh, that’s actually something I’m gonna do.\nNow that’s actually important, but you, but, but you don’t need to worry about the fact that you will be reminded so that if it was something super important, you haven’t just like put it on a list, forgotten about it, and now you’re never gonna look at it again. And then three months later you’re like, oh my God, shit, I really needed to do that.\nAnd I just never, never came back in. You know, I never looked at my list. Right. [00:35:00] So you are saying at least it’s gonna come back in\nTristram: Yeah,\nRobin: and then you can choose, you can choose to highlight it. but presumably some of the things like firstly. has a scaling problem. Because if we assume that you are making more notes than you would you could ever do, this list is gonna get longer and longer and longer until presumably it’s not even skimmable. Right.\nTristram: sure does.\nRobin: and then And then the other thing is, is if you just said every time you said, oh actually I’m not gonna do that now, it increased its difficulty. It’s not necessarily because it’s not difficult. Right. Some of them or, or because it’s difficult. Some of them it might be because actually they don’t matter anymore.\nOr, or it’s like, you know, I over like I’m never gonna, in fact, I would say most of the things, like if you think about it in terms of like how you might work in a software team or how my, my software team works. Um, lots of things come in, we choose certain ones that are to prioritize anything we haven’t prioritized, probably we really should just close or delete or whatever because it’s not gonna happen.\n’cause no one cares. Right. Like, so that’s, so there’s a lot in\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: I would imagine.\nTristram: So this problem of scaling. Is the problem that all inbox systems have. Like once you’ve got more than a screen full of text, of emails of to-dos you, it, it, it ceases to become a useful skimmable inbox and it just becomes kind of too much to handle and you declare bankruptcy and switch system back to something else, and then that system fills up.\nAnd then there’s too many events on your calendar, too many tasks on your software, whatever system you chose. The, the reason that I think misusing spaced repetition for this purpose works geniusly is because it’s extremely granular. Snoozing something until tomorrow is a pretty good way of, uh, of managing your current day.\nUh, list snoozing things to next week. Yeah, that works too. Like you can decide, well, how urgent is this thing I’ll snooze in? This is an algorithmically perfect way of doing that. When you use space repetition, you get one card, like it show, it shows you one card at a time. If you’re using Duolingo, it’d be one word at a time or a phrase or whatever, but here it’s a fleeting note of a time fleeting note at a time.\nAnd I look at that fleeting note and I, and I critically think to myself, what is this really, really urgent? Or is. Is this something I can put off and a little bit or put off a lot? And in the obsidian space, repetition plugin, which I use and recommend you, you’ve got, you get three buttons, easy, medium, hard, or it’s actually easy, good and hard, good.\nBit of a weird, what would word for whatever. And all those do is they say, oh, don’t, don’t increment the reminder day to a bit more in the future or increment it to be a little less in the future or make it really, really urgent. And I actually wanna see it again tomorrow. Um, this, this is obviously the space, uh, the space repetition algorithm where hard things you revise more often.\nEasy things get pushed and pushed, um, exponentially into the future because you actually, you’ve already remembered you’re, you’re okay. Uh, I think that is the same algorithm that I want for my fleeting notes because if I want, if I look at a fleeting note and it’s not something that I really care about, it doesn’t seem very urgent, I’ll just rate it as easy and then I won’t even see it tomorrow.\nI’ll probably see it the next day or the day after that. If, when I’m shown that again in a few days time, I also think, wow, this is not important. This is not important still, then it pushes it even further into the future and it might take a week. So it’s like, it’s a non date, date-based snoozing system that I don’t have to think when am I snoozing it to?\nWhen am I, what am I doing? What am I, whatever. It’s just solved it. I think I could now have. 10,000 fleeting notes at various states of snoozing that the system is just keeping track of.\nRobin: I like that. Um, but I, I suppose by thinking that it’s very, very scalable and it can hold a lot, I would suggest there, there probably is still a limit to how much it can hold you, you like, how would it scale? One way it could scale is that it, um, it, it starts to delay tasks longer and longer so that you don’t get the, you know, you, you could imagine it scaling in that way, right?\nBecause if like a thousand became 10,000, it’s just that you, that, that,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: see each of them less frequently, but that’s not necessarily acceptable. Right. So, so it still has a scaling problem, I would say. And so the piece that I’d want to make sure was built into it somehow was this idea of deleting, closing, you know, getting rid of things that actually don’t matter anymore, but maybe you think that just happens automatically.\nLike obviously if something really doesn’t matter, we’re gonna get rid of it anyway. So it doesn’t really need to, it doesn’t need an extra solution because I do already do it,\nTristram: Yes. Yeah. That, that, that’s, that is, that is the workflow. Like one, after I’ve done something, let’s say the fleeting note is, is like a, an interesting turn of phrase that I think might work really well in one of my podcasts that I’m writing. I will just copy it, put it into the, the podcast note and delete the fleeting note.\nThen I’ll never see it ever again.\nRobin: no, of course. You would delete fleeting notes. I just meant, um, it’s the action of like having a brain fart one day and being like, well, what about this? Throw it into the system tomorrow [00:40:00] or next week. It comes back up and I’m like, actually, you know what, I’m realistically never gonna do that. Get rid of it.\nAnd it’s that, it’s that, that I’d like to reinforce. ’cause I think there is a lot of value in, uh, it’s, it’s like, yeah, it’s, it’s a yny philosophy. That’s not exactly what Yny means because Yny is about building software. But it, but to me it’s important for the same\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: right? Like you could build an infinitely complex software system.\nYou don’t do that because that’s terrible engineering and it’ll probably never be released. So you design it or you don’t undersign it, but you design it right down to the basics in an.\nTristram: Okay. Well, I mean the\nRobin: System. I, I’m loving the sound of, I particularly love the sound of, um, uh, yeah, like being able to snooze without thinking when like it’s really annoying to have to like decide when.\nTristram: yes, it, the problem, the, one of the problems that Zettelkasten solves is. Uh, in a separate, a separate, a separate problem that Zeen solves is when you’re taking a note, you shouldn’t have to think hard about where it goes when you’re just writing something down on the back of an envelope or you’re just quickly putting something in.\nAny friction is bad friction. Like you’re just gonna get that out of your brain on there and then forget about it because you trust the system to bring it back at the correct point, which for me are these morning, these morning reviews. And that’s, that’s what this does. Um, ze is a bottom up, bottom.\nExcuse me. Zein is a bottom up system where instead of saying, okay, like in Dewey Decimal, this goes in science, natural science, chemistry, organic chemistry, we, these are already way too many decisions. Like imagine if you had to do that every time. Nightmare. Whereas in Ce Castine, because it’s bottom up, you clip it straight to, let’s say benzene, and you put the note right under there, you don’t have to go all the way down through whatever hierarchy you’ve got.\nYou just go straight to the, to the edge. Uh, and I think this achieves the same sort of goal because you’re not thinking, well, when am I snoozing this to? And that question is actually very complex and requires knowledge of your calendar or at least thinking of your calendar. No good at all. So,\nRobin: I mean, so, so you see what I find interesting here is that you are talking about Ze Carsten, is a system for ideas and,\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: and talking about task management, and we seem to sort of naturally fallen into an idea that they’re the same thing, which I had not considered before.\nThat they could be the same thing really.\nTristram: They, they, they, they aren’t, but they’re very related. They’re related. The reason I’m conflating them is because we’re talking about the input, the inbox, the fleeting notes, and, and that is, that is unified in my system. And in fact, I would recommend that anyone who is building a second brain or a PKM system for themselves only have one inbox.\nDoesn’t matter whether those are fleeting thoughts or tasks to do, your inbox must be just one place because two places is one too many already. This is a very old idea from, from David Allen’s GTD book. The, uh, the, the grandfather of this inbox idea is that if you have two inboxes, let’s say your email, ancient ancient history.\nAncient history, the like before YouTube, therefore it’s very old. The, if you have two inboxes, your eyes can only look at one at once, which means you cannot fundamentally trust what your eyes are telling you. If your eyes are saying, oh, my inbox empty, but I’ve got this other inbox here, lemme just check that, oh, that’s empty too, but maybe I’ve got a new thing in the first inbox, you it, you’ve got this subtle like subconscious unease that actually maybe you’re supposed to be doing something.\nSo one inbox genius idea. That’s why I’m unifying these two.\nRobin: Yes, except it, that almost makes it more interesting. Are you saying that notes Zettelkasten are tasks or not? Because if you\nTristram: No, no. Fleet. Fleet?\nRobin: you have a Zettelkasten inbox and you have a no.\nTristram: No, no. Just, just fleeting notes are just strings. Strings of text. Those strings of text have to be interpreted by, uh, by Tris tomorrow, and then he will decide whether or not to make a task in my task management system or to write up something else or, or what have you. It’s,\nRobin: so they are the same\nTristram: it’s not up to me.\nRobin: thing.\nTristram: Yes. The inbox is unified.\nRobin: one inbox, which has a list of notes, and a note\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: a task or it may be a thought, a idea.\nTristram: The reason I’m pushing back against this is I, I deliberately don’t decide at this point whether or not it is a tasker of thought\nRobin: but so it’s, so, it’s so, it’s quite, so I suppose, I think you are saying that they are the same thing in every, like as far, just about as far as I could possibly imagine they might be, if you see what I mean. Um, which I like. I mean, it’s a nice, uh, it’s a nice idea. Um, the, the, the bit where I’m gonna\nTristram: tasks start off as ideas, right.\nRobin: the bit where I’m gonna fall down is that you say the place\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: are gonna, where you bring these things back up to your future self is in their morning routine of, of, um, going through the inbox.\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: Um, but that [00:45:00] doesn’t mean, you know, I mean, I do have an inbox. I do go through it every now and then, so I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna\nTristram: I don’t think you should go through the inbox. I think you should set up this, the space repetition system to go through this inbox for you.\nRobin: system for you, the point where you read the things that have been brought back up by our space repetition, uh, repetition system is\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: down and looking through the list of things that your space recognition, uh, repetition system is bringing up.\nTristram: Right. That doesn’t happen for you.\nRobin: Uh, I have. Yes. I don’t think I’ve ever had a routine like, you know, just about managed to brush my teeth daily. Um,\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: but my wake up and sleep times don’t tend to be regular. And I, yes. So I don’t think I can ever say that I’ve had like a string of as much as like a week or two weeks where I have at roughly the same time every day sat down and done roughly the same task, per se, apart from standup at work, which you don’t really have, have any choice. Um,\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: yeah, so I mean, I, I, I don’t think, obviously, you know, you can’t solve all the problems with, of my life with one system. Um, and as I say, I\nTristram: I mean,\nRobin: I\nTristram: maybe.\nRobin: and I do still manage to live as a, as an adult. Um, just about, so I. this wouldn’t be worse. Right. Um, but\nTristram: No, indeed. No indeed. I, I\nRobin: than I am,\nTristram: only, only recently, Robin, only recently, like in 2020 before Lost Terminal, I had no morning routine. Like as you say, I like, I, I, I like cleaned my teeth and I probably had breakfast at some point because my body was hungry. But like the start of this was my, my first habit, which was I’ve got to write lost terminal before work.\nIf I don’t write it before work, I’ll work. I’ll be too tired after work. So it must happen before work, therefore it must, must, must happen. It’s like you taking the, your, your kids to to school. Like it can’t not happen. It’s the, it absolutely must happen. And I, my baby lost terminal had had the same scheduling problem that it, these things had to happen every day.\nSo I was actually forced into that. And then after a few, after like a year, I had this morning routine of like sitting down and writing and then I could like hang things off it. You know, you just need that one thing, you know, that first little habit.\nRobin: the, but the interesting thing there is you described Lost Terminal as your baby, uh, with, with an implication that that’s part of how you managed to do it, which is, which is very insightful. I mean, you know, you’re absolutely right that the most routine things that I do successfully are my children’s routine because they need\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: and I know that and I care about them. And it’s that caring that I’m really sort of curious about because I also feel like, you know, my life has, is, is, is improving significantly recently. Um, and it\nTristram: Great.\nRobin: in taking charge of it. Which is a version of caring. It’s like caring about myself. It’s like I’m taking the time to think what is it that I really care about?\nAnd, and so that makes a\nTristram: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: difference. So, so, so really it just needs the, something to trigger me into believing this routine supports my core values. Right? Like, like that’s\nTristram: Hmm.\nRobin: and then I would do it. Right. So, so it’s not, probably not as far as, as we’re saying. So anyway, I really like the system.\nUm, I, I am curious, I don’t think you should maybe go into it further now ’cause we, this will get long, but I’m, I’m\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: how you configure your, um, scheduled something, whatever you call it, that system\nTristram: Yes, the, the space repetition system. Well, you and I can talk offline about it, and the listener will eventually be able to watch my video on it.\nRobin: that’s pretty cool. Oh, yes. Well, so will I, so maybe, maybe I can just, if, if we don’t manage to follow up on it, I can just watch a video and then I’ll know.\nTristram: It’s perfect.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/2/","title":"Agoraphobia and Thinking in Systems"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/3/":{"body":"\n\nWe get excited about the stats on episode 1 and talk a little about podcast logistics.

I’ve crunched the stats and between YouTube and the podcast feed, there have been so far 4,000 plays of episode one, which is insane.\nRobin: Is amazing.\nTristram: we a week into it? That’s wonderful.\nRobin: but do we\nTristram: I.\nRobin: Is that does that include crawlers and things or do we know their real\nTristram: Hmm.\nI think we’re okay with this data because it falls off organically, like huge numbers of people listened on day one, two, and then it has fallen off more organically. Whereas a crawler, I would expect periodic or something more like that.\nAnd certainly not MP three, like crawling, an MP three is a bit weird, But anyway, the point is that these 4,000 people are incredible. Presume the listener is one of those peopleThat is, astonishing and I’m very grateful as I’m sure you are.\nRobin: you. Yes.\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: I never\nTristram: So\nRobin: to be as popular as it’s been already.\nTristram: yes.\nRobin: We haven’t really figured out the format of the show yet.\nTristram: Yeah I think it’s quite nice to figure it out, almost with the listener, although in a very, one way relationship there, but we’ll figure it out as we go. I’ve got a bit of housekeeping here, so thanks everyone who commented and has been chatting on the Discord, this is all fantastic.\nThe feedback’s been wonderful. And we are especially grateful to those who’ve signed up to the Patreon patreon.com/deencapsulate or it’s all on the website. The patrons get at the moment, early episodes,\nRobin: website,\nTristram: so when it,\nRobin: is deencapsulate.com,\nTristram: yes you’re a natural robin, you’re a natural. You’ve just gotta say it all the time, repetitive, but we, if we don’t do it, who else will?\nRobin: Early episode. So when, for example, when this episode drops in the public feed, patrons will have access to episode four already. Yeah\nTristram: We’ve also got a merch store. You go to encapsulate and click on store. There is exactly one item. Available for purchasing. And that is the square dashed logo thing. I’m not even sure if it is the exact final design, but what did you say this was gonna be Robin?\nLike an early\nRobin: first edition.\nTristram: low Yes. First edition before Tris has quite got the logo symmetrical. I’ve been learning Vector illustration using Inkscape, the fantastic open source tool that is in some ways better than an illustrator.\nwe get almost no commission from this. This is more about a fun thing for the community to do to publicly let you set your commission. And I think the price is already, like the base price is already, correct for that sort of thing. I’ve set it as low as possible.\nTo support us, Patreon is the best option, but you also don’t need to do a thing. You can just keep listening, keep recommending things to your friends. As I said in episode one, this is the only way podcasts can work is word of mouth. There’s no algorithms. Although I have now submitted the show to about a dozen different podcast indexes and stores and so forth.\nI think we’re gonna talk about feedback.\nyes.\nRobin: about the fact that this is we’re, we are doing this together with the user,I thought that would be a beautiful segue into talking about feedback because that’s how, it’s two way.\nTristram: Right, well Reminded. So there are a few ways you can give us feedback, but the best way for our organization, and so that I see it and Robin sees it and we both can be involved in the conversation, is on the website to capsulate.com. If you go through to each individual episode in addition to the full transcript, we’ll go about that later.\nIn addition to the full transcript, at the very bottom of the page, there is a comment box, but this comment box is powered by GitHub discussions. So this has a huge advantage in that all of the discussion is actually in one place. If you look at the discussions on GitHub, you can search through them, you can attach files, you can write in markdown, all of the good stuff that we have come to expect from GitHub.\nBut it’s also this nice little comment box. And this is powered by Guus, G-I-S-C-S app, which is an open source GitHub discussions comment system. Really happy about that. And most importantly, probably for the listener, this emails me when you comment. Now, it may or may not email Robin. Your notification settings are your own, but I will at least see it\nRobin: No, I\nTristram: we can chat about it.\nRobin: my notifications for it. I hadn’t thought of that yet, but I’ll make sure I do it.\nTristram: Yeah, selective notifications. I’m a big fan of notifications off by default in general, but turning on very important things, like your partner your teachers, that sort of thing. So if you’re listening to this, that’s how to give us feedback at the bottom of the episode page on the main site, comment using the discuss or go straight to the repo if you’re familiar with GitHub, and start making some new threads.\nGive us some suggestions, some [00:05:00] corrections or whatever. There were quite a lot of mistakes in the episode one video I used descrip, which is what we’re using to record this and do the initial edit which is a great tool.\nThe problem is it makes mistakes into the video, and I can’t fix them because YouTube do not let you, do not let you make changes or re-upload a video. I think it is possible. If you are a very fancy YouTuber, like millions of subscribers and you’ve got a personal connection to a YouTube manager or something, you can beg them to do a re-upload\nBut that is not for mere mortals like us. I dunno if I’ve ever told you my theory, Robin, about why YouTube doesn’t let you edit videos, which is strange.\nRobin: No I don’t think so.\nWe’ve immediately gone off topic, but I think it is, it’ll be interesting to our listeners at least. Let’s try and keep it short.\nTristram: Yeah, exactly. We got stuff to get through. The, I think the biggest reason that YouTube do not let you edit your videos is not for like fraud reasons so that you could get a load of videos and then change the video to make it look like people liked something that it wasn’t or anything like that.\nIt is because as with everything Google Do, it all comes back for advertising. The way advertising works in podcasts is that Robin and I could approach a podcast advertising network and they could splice in their adverts into parts of our episodes. I really. Don’t think we will do that for advertising, because I personally hate those.\nI prefer host red ads, but it is possible to automate this and keep things fresh so that you listen to it one week, you get one ad, you listen to it. The next week you get the more updated ad, which is presumably better for everyone. YouTube runs their own ad platform, and if they let you edit your video, they would let in competing ad platforms\nRobin: Oh,\nTristram: because you could splice your own ads later on into videos.\nYou see what I mean?\nRobin: People do put ads in videos anyway, but you are saying they can’t be changed after you’ve put them in\nTristram: Yes. That’s a big feature of these podcast ad networks is that they will keep your ads up to date, which increases yield for everyone,\nRobin: yeah.\nTristram: I feel that is a problem for podcasting, at least in the way I’d want to do it, because people give over their podcast to these advertising networks to then put these ads in between. And I think often, I particularly listened to quite a lot of leftist, political shows\nAspace communism shows. Yes, I know.\nRobin: and there’s quite a lot of things like, so I was listening to like the intercepted podcast, and only adverts in this podcast at the beginning of the end were two. British voiced, and therefore, not very clearly notfrom the original feed for Starbucks. And a big a big topic of intercepted in general is like Gaza and Israel and Palestine and all that kind of stuff.\nAnd Starbucks are one of the, one of the boycott targets. So it was rather jarring, I sent\nTristram: oh.\nRobin: about it but you lose control of exactly what adverts on your podcast, which concerns me a bit.\nTristram: I would like to promise to the listener at this stage that we will never do something like that and we will run Host Red Ads if and when we are lucky enough to be able to get income through the show. It will be Host Red Ads by Robin and me from companies that we genuinely love and are not like destroying the planet.\nAnd if you disagree, Robin will delete this from the edit and nobody will ever hear this, but I bet you agree.\nRobin: I certainly agree.\nTristram: Good, good.\nDigital Gardening\nTristram: Have I got a great, wonderful little slice of what kind of feels like the cozy internet for you. So I’ll start off with some definitions. Digital gardening is a way of working in the open. So instead of working on a, let’s say, a blog post for many months and getting it all perfect and then publishing it,\nRobin: Who could you be referring to?\nTristram: Anyone, anyone could do this perfectionism is a great curse in our society instead of working on that privately and trying to get it as good as you can.\nDigital gardening is where you work in the open in a interconnected series of notes and you potter by which I mean you do a little here, do a little there. You’ve got a lot of ideas, a lot of documents, a lot of posts, a lot of thoughts, half done, and you bounce between them, improving them all\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: bits.\nRobin: you do a little bit of weeding here. You kinda bend this round so it can\nTristram: That’s it.\nRobin: To the vine. To, to the like trellis a bit better over there,\nTristram: ah, the dream.\nRobin: a while. Yeah.\nTristram: It is absolute hobbit core. Publishing, like very cozy, very just a dream. It feels very much like the scrappy websites of old, they were always under construction, weren’t they? You never have an under construction website. Now it’s always, this is my perfect brand.\nPlease subscribe to my substack. It’s very polished and boring. if you were to visit a digital garden [00:10:00] like namtao.com, the first thing you’ll see is not posts reverse chronological lauder, like a blog. If you’ll excuse me, like if you go to robin winslow.co uk,\nRobin: Oof calling me\nTristram: uh,\nRobin: Oh\nTristram: I’m not saying that is bad.\nI’m saying you have got a blog, whereas a digital garden is a web of linked pages,\nRobin: yeah.\nTristram: very much like what the web was designed for. The clue is in the name. It’s not a timeline, which are, I dunno about you, but I am real tired of timelines these days. But it’s more something that you’ve gotta explore.\nThings aren’t super signposted. You might have to go to one page, then another, and then circle back and get lost a little bit. It’s not very monetizable. It’s not very contenty but it is lovely. That is digital gardening. I will make sure in the show notes we’ve got a link to Maggie Appleton’s page on the history and ethos of the digital garden, I believe is what that is called.\nDigital gardening. There’s a lot of videos on YouTube of people who’ve taken up digital gardening who were inspired by Maggie’s amazing blog post In it be very cleverly signposts. How finished each page on her site is by describing them as seedlings ideas that have been planted buds, the seeds that are started sprouting and trees maybe, fully formed ideas that she,\nRobin: is so amazing. This is like exactly what I need.\nTristram: I knew it would be. That’s why I’ve brought it here for you. So this is lovely. This is exactly what you want and it fits really nicely into obsidian namtao.com is based on the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin, which lets you put in the front matter a checklist that says, Hey, publish this page, and then handles all of the linking, uploading of images.\nAnd it even supports like mermaid diagrams and incredibly obsidian data view, which is a third party plugin, not core to obsidian, but it might as well be core to obsidian. It’s very nice. perhaps I’ll find a few other examples of digital gardens.\nRobin: So sorry, what’s the relationship between namta.com and obsidian?\nTristram: namta.com is created from markdown documents inside my obsidian fault.\nRobin: So it’s created for markdown documents in the same way that any static site is. Is there like tech, as in from that markdown that leads to the website. Does that share anything with obsidian or is it just two different systems?\nTristram: It\nRobin: the same\nTristram: is extreme. It’s extremely deeply integrated. There is an obsidian plugin called Digital Garden, and this gives you like a command in obsidian to publish single pages or all pages that have the checkbox DG publish in the properties in the MET data.\nAnd this pushes up to GitHub using the GitHub, API not.\nUsing Git. The command line uses the GitHub, API, to directly add these files to the repo. This is clever ’cause it means it works on mobile where you don’t have access to the Git client. So it uses the GitHub, API to push these files there. And then on the GitHub side, there is a GitHub action, which crunches those markdown files into a website like any other static site generator.\nIt’s just that these are designed to work together. You just, clone and copy their repo and just get going. so the advantage of this over a more traditional static site generator is that in a traditional static site generator, you can have unpublished markdown, but it has to be in the GitHub repo.\nIt might have a little checklist that says, don’t, this is a draft, but it’s still in public. People can still look at it on the GitHub repo\nRobin: But with the digital garden plugin, you keep all your notes private in your obsidian vault, which can be private on Dropbox using obsidian sync, whatever you like. And you only push the documents as you want to make them public.\nSorry. Not by putting ’em in a folder\nTristram: no by putting this front matter property called DG Publish. And it’s a Boolean True. False.\nRobin: puts it in gi.\nTristram: Exactly.\nSo it’s just what I was looking for because I want all of namtao.com, which has my video scripts and everything, including lost terminal scripts, lost terminal characters.\nLike everything. I like it. It’s the whole thing for all of my projects. I want those to also be on GitHub in markdown, that people can give me poor requests for if I make mistakes or if they want to improve them or whatever.\nbut I also wanted privacy because this is just my normal vault with obsidian.\none of the big rules that I learned very early on is don’t have multiple vaults, have one vault and figure it out.\nRobin: yeah.\nTristram: Because interlinking is what we’re doing here. I didn’t expect such a strong reaction from you, Robin, but I’m delighted. ’cause this, in hindsight, this is exactly what you need, right?\nRobin: I was actually, I was finding it quite funny when you said because it uses the gout API, [00:15:00] therefore it works on mobile and it might seem like such a trivial point unless you’ve tried to do this thing of to like, I don’t know, blog on the train on your phone or whatever. it’s so important. it’s such a centrally important feature. I can’t even it’s, yeah. Anyway, sorry. how long have you been keeping this from me?\nTristram: Maybe\nsix months.\nI can only apologize.\nRobin: it.\nTristram: Look, it actually gets better\nRobin: acceptable.\nTristram: the heading I’ve got for this section is digital gardening and Aze Carston. So I’ve realized that they are the same thing. I don’t think I’m the first person to figure this out,\nRobin: Yes.\nTristram: but they’re extremely. Compatible because in z Augustine, you take your fleeting notes and thoughts, ideas that you’ve had by while reading or listening or watching something, and you process them into permanent notes sometimes called atomic notes.\nAnd these are single units of teachable knowledge. And they let me have a look at my atomic notes. So I’ve got an atomic note that says, using copilot GPT to automate the easy stuff is the opposite of doing code cutters. And that sort of single thread, that single idea struck out of some ideas I had whilst watching some videos or reading stuff or just like doing the dishes or whatever.\nAnd I filtered it through and made this atomic note. Now that is not a blog post, but it also is something that I was happy enough to post on Mastodon perhaps a month or so ago. And so there’s something between a thought that you have had and a blog post and sometimes that’s\nRobin: blog post.\nTristram: Exactly. So there’s this continuum and I think that you don’t actually need to. Post these things on Twitter or Mastodon, you could have them on your digital garden ready for people to browse through if you are happy with these atomic ideas. And they’re not too private. But if they’re well fleshed out and you’ve got some references, as usually happens when you’re making these robust atomic notes, they’re naturally branched.\nThey’re naturally linking to each other. They flow through and ideas string themselves together. And you get like a sequence of atomic notes that build upon each other. Let’s look at that atomic note. Using copilot to automate the easy stuff is the opposite. Getting code casters.\nI’ve got a note before that says, AI can only reduce complexity, and those are linked threaded through. And so that one idea follows another, and they eventually, if I kept adding on thoughts to this string of ideas, this string of atomic notes, if I kept stringing more and more together, I might eventually have a video.\nA video script or a blog post idea. this is literally how my last AI video happened. I just had these little ideas that came together and I developed them and I built them into atomic notes that I was pretty pleased with. They seemed to stand alone on their own, and I strung them together.\nAnd eventually I had the outline of my script. AI is Not for You. Which is a few videos ago, and it feels like I could probably do this in public, in my digital garden. I could publish my atomic notes with links between them and people could browse around and find a little bit of meaning for themselves should they wish to.\nRobin: Yeah, this is what I’ve always wanted to do, and some have never found the structure that supports it ish. Like I’m not very private and I don’t really want to be very private. And I believe in openness and I would love it if, I think also you don’t need to, general, you don’t really need to be scared of putting things out there because a lot of people who don’t publish, and this might be a thing that changes with the new TikTok generation or whatever, but like people who don’t publish, can be very scared of outputting anything at all. when you actually start to do it, I think you realize that there’s so much information out there that nobody cares. Like predominantly nobody cares. Like you have to be quite,\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: Known or say saying something interesting in some way for anybody to care, right?\nSo for the most part it’s gonna just it’s inconsequential and so you don’t need to be scared of it. so I would love to be able to do exactly what you’re saying and throw up small thoughts. have a structure for them to be drawn together into larger thoughts.\nSomething that I think possibly I would distress me when you try and turn it into a website is like in obsidian, obviously I can create whatever mess I like because it’s only for me to come back to right\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: online. I feel a certain obligation to try and avoid link rot, right? If I had a fleeting thought that I throw up in someplace that you can find through looking through my website, and then someone finds it and they find it interesting, but then later I want to evolve it into something a bit bigger.\nAnd so therefore I might turn that into this other thing. And that old thing might be gone now it’s a 4 0 4, right?\nTristram: I’ve got an answer for you,\nRobin: would concern me.\nTristram: I’ve got an answer for you. If you’re using a robust [00:20:00] tool like obsidian, it renames links as you rename pages, and I admit that doesn’t solve deleting a page, you’ll then end up with a broken link there. But it’s not without a modicum of control.\nAs long as you don’t expect like a, I would imagine you’re not thinking of, oh, ha, having a 4 0 4 when I delete a page, that’s actually very normal.\nYou’re worried about having a 4 0 4,\nRobin: Sure.\nTristram: right? You are worried about it like somehow links breaking when you move things around. Obsidian solves that by keeping all links working.\nRobin: Does it, as in, it’s not on obsidian, like the, what did you call it? Is it called digital garden?\nTristram: It is just called the digital garden plugin.\nRobin: it is the digital garden plugin that’s gonna have to take care of it because something has to be listening for requests and turn them into three oh twos or three oh ones, right?\nLike\nObsidian\nTristram: yes.\nRobin: that.\nTristram: What the plugin does is every time you publish it. Uses all of the links as they are currently in your obsidian vault. So if the links in your obsidian vault are still working, they will still work on the website.\nSo you\nRobin: expecting links to break. What I’m saying is bookmarks will break\nTristram: Ah I see. So if I move something around, if I change its name, somebody will link to my site and it will no longer be there. Great.\nRobin: yeah\nTristram: okay. so there are two ways to think about this. The first one is that there’s a method in just like in many static site generators, you can throw something into the front matter that says link slug or link URL or whatever.\nAnd then you’ve got yourself a permanent link. So no matter where you change the do, that’s all fine. Problem solved.\nRobin: Second option is that the very nature of the digital garden is that things are a little bit in flux, but because we are not separating this out into a thing that is all public and a thing that is all private, because it’s blended, we have got a much more granular way of doing things.\nTristram: If you go to namtao.com and the first option is no Boilerplates, and if you click read more, the ur l is namtao.com/nb. My digital gardenmy obsidian note for that is not called nb. It’s called something like No Boilerplate Home,\nBut I’ve got this perma link called nb, and then in the video section I’ve got some of my videos listed.\nEach of those videos also has a PERMA link, because I think I’m very likely to link those from outside. But if you go back into something more relaxed, like lost Terminal, everything under, so Lost Terminal is nta com slash lt. That’s a perma link, but everything under it is dynamic because I.\nWant the freedom to just move things around, change characters, names, change where people live, change the whole topography of it. But you’ll still be able to go to the lost terminal section of my garden because I’ve made a little, I dunno what the metaphor should be. A stone archway that says Abandon or hope.\nNo. The opposite. Get some hope.\nSo it’s read more under the lost terminals section on the front page. If you click read more at the bottom of that Green Hope punk sci-fi.\nRobin: so it’s the read more and the fact that you’ve got an LT slash which you’re\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: archway. And then you’re saying within this things move around, which means that if I click on LT season oh eight, or I’m trying to figure out what I could, okay, so you’ve got a note, you’ve got a keratin note section, right? So if I clicked on one of these, for example volunteer or whatever, and which is empty, for example. But let’s say you’ve written a few sentences in there, but then you decide to change her name. You are just saying there’s no promise that you’d necessarily find that it was here if you came back here.\nTristram: Am saying that there is a granular promise you can expect my garden to have a lost terminal section. In 10 years time, you can very reasonably visit my house, come into my garden and say, oh, I remember this lost terminal section. It’s the same place that I’ve, I remember it, but look at all these new flowers you’ve planted, and those, some of those old flowers, some of those old shrubs have moved.\nWhere’s that old oak tree? Oh, you cut it down.\nLike I don’t like, I know that cool URLs don’t change, but there is a gotta be some granularity to that binary when it, when in the digital garden\nRobin: to recti because, ’cause I love HTPI love the internet. I love the fundamental\nTristram: should.\nRobin: Of the internet. And I suppose I feel like spiritually what you’re describing here is a bit the essence of what we think the internet should be like.\nAs in pure internet is the one where people are represented by their own domains rather than through\nSome, conglomerate. In those domains they have, freedom of expression. You get to come along and experience the things that they wanna put out there. Freely. Because I feel like. The core standards of the internet and this idea of your own digital garden of self-expression are so overlapping. Like that’s what the internet’s there to enable. trying to therefore [00:25:00] reconcile some of the standards, with this vision, but I think you’re right that it’s probably just that I’m being too precious about broken links.\nThere are ones that you can rely on and\nAre ones you can’t, and obviously you can make your 4 0 4 page helpful, right? So yeah. So I think it’s a point that we don’t need to focus on anymore, but I just, I, that’s where my mind went. But\nTristram: one of the things that you might be able to do is advance the signposting of each ’cause currently I’m breaking a rule of digital gardening that I’ve not signposted which of these pages are in progress and which of these progress are more like our buds or seedlings or trees or, I forget exactly.\nSo you could say when it is at the highest level of confidence, it gets a permalink.\nRobin: yeah. Like a tree with a, it is a good metaphor because a.\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: A tree, you don’t expect to disappear.\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: down a\nSacrilege, right?\nTristram: Yes. The tree is gonna survive a hurricane, potentially.\nRobin: Might not that,\nTristram: Maybe. Yeah. A storm. Certainly. Drought, perhaps. Yeah, exactly. I do. You’d like it?\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: I do.\nRobin: I do and I will be playing with it also not very happy with the fact that my blog is a completely, inaccessible, chronological list. And I think it should be much more thematic and it doesn’t need to be neat. Like it could absolutely just be, I want you to be able to meander through it by topic, and I just haven’t made it like that, because I, in a way, I’m a bit too vain like I was really proud of the styling of my blog because it’s supposed to be elegant and usable straightforward and it’s, yeah, like the text is big enough.\nit doesn’t use more colors than it needs. But it’s, trying to be elegant and make it as easy to read the content and access content as possible. in that mission it’s a bit like also the thing that blocks me from throwing content up because I’m being too perfectionist about it,\nthat’s why it’s not messy in the way that I think actually would be a much better representation me. So I will be, I hope I will find the time quite soon to recraft my blog as a digital garden because I love the idea.\nTristram: I love the idea is good.\nRobin: keeping it from me for six months.\nTristram: I’m so sorry. It’s pretty cool. like every morning I do two hours of pottering before I get into my lost terminal writing.\nRobin: it’s just.\nTristram: I just, and I literally very often will wake up before my alarm. Really excited to go do that because\nI’ve blended my ze casting knowledge base, my project management and my digital garden all into one thing. And I like it’s like I’m gonna be working on all of this at the same time, without any real goal, but just knowing that I’m increasing the progress on lots of little things that are important to my life in this system.\nIt’s just the best thing ever.\nRobin: That’s amazing. If you succeed in turning me into a sort of constant gardener of my website, I feel a bit like you’ll have saved my life. Like, I feel like I’m I’m I just, I don’t have the, I think I don’t have the space, the freedom to just in that way and everything is yeah. I would love that. if I could just, go and spend half an hour wandering through my web garden and pruning it and helping a bit grow here every day. That would be amazing.\nTristram: There we go. we’ll see how much of that we’re comfortable keeping in, but that was lovely. Let’s press on.\nOkay.\nme about Tess Riel.\nRobin: Qui, yes, it’s a little bit of an ungainly title for a topic. So do you know fundamentally who Tim, Nick Gabriel is?\nTristram: No.\nRobin: You may do, when I explain who she is timber Gabriel was a she worked for Google\nAnd she was in the AI safety I think, and she published a paper, which is this stochastic parrots paper. heard of the term stochastic parrots? It’s a description of LLM generative AI systems.\nTristram: Oh, of course it is. Yeah, that makes sense.\nso she, the paper basically says that AI is harmfulSure.\nRobin: making some points about safety and things that Google should focus on.\nAnd she was fired. And she very cleverly made use of fired by Google in her personal branding, I think.\nTristram: That’ll do it.\nRobin: but she set up a research company after that. And then she worked with this philosopher called Emily Lee, or Emil, I dunno how to pronounce it p Torres. And they came up with this term, tere. I think why this is interesting is because you have to ask yourself, given that AI has had many different meanings, but at the moment is these generative sort of lamb based, algorithms.\nTristram: Huh.\nRobin: if you understand, how incapable they are of solving many of the problems that people claim that they can solve, you have to ask yourself the question, how come so many incredibly wealthy investors have [00:30:00] put so much money into developing these AI systems? What is it that leads to that happening? Like was this an obsession of Silicon Valley? Why did people, represent such a significant fantasy that then diverted, and trillions of dollars and completely transformed the American economy through doing that based on the production of systems which were not gonna get anywhere near delivering on their stated\nTristram: right.\nRobin: And so to answer that question, they’ve gone explored the ideology of the people who might invest. of the AI believers, the AI boosters and the, and particularly the AI investors, and so I suppose this is the reveal. TES real stands for transhumanism Exrop, pianism singularitarian, cosmism rationalism, rationalist ideology. Effective altruism and long-termism. And they draw out through this paper, which I would recommend if anybody is actually interested enough to read it. It is an easy to read paper. It’s very well written, and it’s not long. But it lays out the links between all of these overlapping ideologies and how they lead together. How significant advocacy or belief in these ideologies the line, the through line that links all of the different, aI boosters who have pushed the idea that we are heading for an AI apocalypse or that there’s the AI is this powerful thing that’s gonna take over the world that we really need to or that it’s gonna transform or it’s gonna be the thing that’s inevitably gonna transform humanity and save all the lives.\nLike all these people who are pushing all of those fantasies that really cannot flow from, if you understand what in fact an LLM based generative algorithm is, right?\nTristram: Yeah. It’s also correct. Trained on the internet.\nRobin: those, this bucket of ideologies is what pushes it. And you can trace it all the way through.\nSo the word that draws all these ideologies together, you could say as eugenics, because it’s basically an idea that you can craft yourself through whatever mechanisms, through manipulating things. You’re trying to build yourself a sort of perfect model human or a perfect model being that’s able to like, transcend humanity. and it’s similar to what eugenicists, would’ve been doing with the Arian race in Nazi Germany. There was a lot of long history of eugenics thought that. Eugenics was. The idea that there was racial traits in racial superiority was held as a scientific truth for a surprising amount of 20th century, right?\nNot just focused around the 19 19th, thirties I’d say extending significantly beyondand it sort of infected the way that people thought about lots of different things. But this is the thread that ties all together.\nSo I just firstly, I think it’s really interesting to ask that question like, what happened in humanity that led to so much investment of such a significant sum of all of the product of humanity being invested in this complete fantasy, right?\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: that’s a really interesting question to ask.\nAnd then I think the answer is really interesting that these ideas really overlap and they’re all linked and they’re linked through this belief that you can transcend all of the flaws of humanity in this like creation. And they just believe in that so strongly that they will look for evidence and they will find every opportunity to reinforce it without asking too many questions. Do you know what I mean?\nTristram: Right.\nRobin: think it’s really amazing.\nTristram: That I admit, I don’t know very much about this entire space. Other than the small bits about transhumanism and\nwhat were the other, what were the other bits that, that\nRobin: altruism, long-termism?\nTristram: yes. Like it’s always easier to imagine helping a future person than actually give money to a homeless person today. I don’t think of them particularly highly\nRobin: yes.\nTristram: of altruism people quite apart from that crypto, bro.\nRobin: journey of effective altruism, I think is fascinating because and it’s significantly based around Sam, Bankman Frees, that’s name, I think, right?\nTristram: Yes. Not the best poster child for it. Yeah.\nRobin: But like effect altruism in its founding, I think was at least interesting.\nSo there’s, I can’t remember his full name, but there’s a guy called Peter, someone who’s like a philosopher. I think he was probably Oxford or something like that. and he’s sort of the founder or one of the fathers of this movement. And he’s basically saying, if you really try and quantify your altruism. Then you’ll see that you might think that you could help a homeless person in your city, but if you live in the west and you send that money to Africa, you could save way more lives. That’s quite an interesting basis. So that’s where you start.\nIf we were to follow that through and we were to calculate the different ways in which we could actually increase the way that we could help people, then that would be better because we could work out how to help more people. The thing is that then led, like [00:35:00] where that led is insane.\nSo the first insane place that people start to say, this is what Sam b for free did I think I’m gonna get a job in finance so I can make more money and then I can give it away.\nTristram: Yes.\nRobin: and now there’s and that then obviously led to basically the most egregious and largest version.\nI, I, what’s the right term? I don’t know if money laundering is the right term, but it’s the\nTristram: Raw was it\nRobin: It is fraud, but it’s like this the inventing of money, the passing around between companies that are supposed to be independent. They’re like, yeah, just like writing fake numbers into books.\nIt’s exactly all the same stuff that like Enron was doing\nTristram: is. Is that securities fraud?\nRobin: Probably, yeah.\nTristram: Is that what that is?\nRobin: would, would’ve been doing securities fraud. But like all of this stuff was justified\nMind, I think because he’s I am, I’m a good place to be given a lot of money because I’m gonna be giving it away.\nAnd I think he did give a lot of money away to some good causes, but would be arguable whether they were better causes than like other people with the money you might have given it to. So I don’t know, but like that, that the first thing is this idea that you can therefore get like one of the most unethical jobs just because you’re making a lot of money and then you give it away as like a way to do good, which seems pretty suspect to me in the first place. then obviously the other place EA goes, which is just absolutely nuts, is the idea of future, as you say, future lives versus present lives. Like we are going to imagine some kind of future where there’s a lot more humans and those ones would be hurt by, this thing. And they don’t turn it to climate change.\nThis is the really mind boggling thing. So\nTristram: oh no,\nRobin: they don’t use it as an argument for climate change. They use it as an argument for why they have to explore into planetary travel or again, ai, right? We need ai ’cause it’ll save us from climate change. I guess there might be a bit of a climate change argument there, but you do it through ai.\nLike the only way to solve climate change is to invest in ai, I think. Have you heard that argument?\nTristram: I have not. I would not believe it if somebody made it to me.\nRobin: exists. This is definitely an\nTristram: Ugh.\nRobin: people make.\nTristram: It does seem it’s the perfect ethos for an investor for whom every tomorrow is worth the unethical practices of today. Like it lines up perfectly with being somebody who just wants to see the number go up. And if someone’s telling you that, oh, that’s ethical. Marvelous. What a dream,\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: I’m so happy for them.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. I think that’s exactly right. I think what’s interesting about this paper as well, is that she’s saying like on the left, where we recognize that capitalism is destructive, right?\nEasy, therefore to say everything is the fault of capitalism. So all these people who are doing toxic things, they’re doing it because they’re driven by a pro profit motive. Now, I don’t think that’s true because I think that once you get beyond a certain level of wealth, the wealth no longer, may matter to you in some small time way.\nLike you might want to keep your status as a trillionaire, right? So that you don’t lose face against your. Buddy you are competing with or whatever, right?\nTristram: Right.\nRobin: broadly speaking, that’s not your big driver. big driver is something else. It’s something ideological, right? It’s not, I’m just doing everything because it makes me more money. I think you will inevitably be trying to make more money because you employ people who make sure that’s gonna be the case and whatever. They make smart investments. So what you are saying about being able to make an argument through effective altruism about investment, I think is right?\nLike about it being good investment is right. But I think the thing about test reel is it explains the really impactful thing is are the people that have all the money, that have all the power and their actual driver is something else, right? So what is their actual driver? these are to draw that out. Do you see what I mean?\nTristram: It does. It sounds like I should read the paper to find that out. it does, it draws a thread between all of these different kinds people and explains what links them all and what motivates all of these different groups?\nIs that, did I get that right?\nRobin: Yeah. I mean it’s basically saying they’re overlapping. It’s saying that there’s actually a bit of a journey between them. But if you look at some of the people you might draw out, so you’ve got obviously SBF, you’ve got Sam Altman, you’ve got Hinton, Jeffrey Hinton.\nYou’ve got so all these AI boosters, if you inspect their ideologies, you find that they include some subset of this bucket and they overlap quite significantly. Do you see what I mean? and they evidence this, I think they, put it quite clearly to show that these are, defining beliefs of the set of people that are responsible for this direction in technology investment.\nTristram: Interesting.\nRobin: Yeah, that’s the topic. I find it fascinating. I bring it to you, I suppose a little bit because I feel like broadly speaking, it’s my kind of thing and not your kind of thing. But I wanna see how interested you are in it. ’cause I love, sociology and philosophy and ideas and ideologies.\nAnd also I guess bad people, understanding the things that harm us or lead us astray. Yeah.\nTristram: It’s, I have been very interested in, thank you very much for explaining this to me and I hope some of our listeners will find it useful as well. the [00:40:00] thing that. I am left with is that it’s wild. They didn’t want to solve climate change. Like the is such a low hanging fruit.\nRobin: Yeah. as an overall statement that might not be fair. It’s just that there might be people there that really care about it, but SBF probably cared about it. It is just the way that he would want to go about it as suspect, maybe, I don’t know.\nI dunno enough really just to comment.\nTristram: You certainly, don’t need to invest in space travel\nRobin: yeah, certainly.\nTristram: Like you, the there is a very clear order of things to fix and space travel is not on that list.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTristram: It’s like that is not to say that weather satellites are not very useful in combating climate change, but like space tourism probably not\nRobin: certainly. No, that’s, but it’s the idea of planetary escape, isn’t it?\nTristram: right?\nRobin: that one version, I suppose it’s if you try and map this out, and this is what these clever people do, and they clever, clever brains, right? Is you are like, look. Let’s say there’s a 30% chance that we fail to save the planet, and climate change destroys it and makes it completely uninhabitable, right? it’s an ethical good to save the human race, so therefore we should be investing some amount of money in the ability to move to Mars. Do you see what I mean?\nTristram: Yeah. It’s a preposterous argument. Mars is not very habitable, like even the worst ravages. I’m I think I, we’re now in my wheelhouse. ’cause we’re talking about a post environmental apocalypse, which is all I write about in Lost Terminal. I do a huge amount of research to try and make it right.\nEven like the most grim, awful predictions don’t involve the planet. Not having any oceans. Mars doesn’t have any oceans. even if there is a catastrophe, like the, it’s actually the opposite problem. The ocean is gonna bring the party to us. It’s not that the ocean’s gonna go away, it’s gonna have too much ocean.\nRobin: yeah.\nTristram: Like in Lost terminal, in my story, 10 meters sea level rise is what I chose in 2020. That was a wildly optimistic thing. In hindsight actually, we’re like, that would be, if every country immediately changed what they were doing and focused on climate change, we might only have 10 meters of sea level to rise.\nI apologize in advance. For\nRobin: a fact to drop, isn’t it?\nTristram: I’m sorry. I, especially, I’m sorry for our Dutch listenersWhen I think Amsterdam is three meters below sea level it’s gonna be a bad time for Hitachi friends. Which is especially sad because I believe that the Netherlands on the whole are amazing at investing ingood climate policies and so forth.\nCertainly they’ve got the first iron powered brewery. So it’s like carbon neutral because they’re burning iron. I cannot go off topic about how much I love the Netherlands. Yeah, it’s cool.\nRobin: I think it brings a little bit of wholesomeness to my topic\nTristram: We should just like solve climate change. It’s much\nRobin: It\nTristram: like.\nRobin: saying is yes, obviously we need to solve climate change if we’re gonna stay here, but also the best solving of climate change still means we’re going to have massive challenges in terms of environmental changes. And so therefore we have to solve climate change and work out how to deal with the changing environment.\nTristram: Having a\nRobin: right?\nTristram: Yes, having Planet two is a great idea. That doesn’t remove Planet one, right? Like Planet one will still exist in this hypothetical utopia where we’ve become a multi-plan species. Like the solution is not, ignore the first planet with, conservatively 10 billion people on.\nThat doesn’t sound good, but it does sound good to the kind of person who imagines themselves going to planet\nRobin: yeah. But it’s not just that they, the thing that I think is commonthe through line is that it’s the fantasy of it. Like I’ve always been struck\nThat the people who claim to be Our smartest, leaders, right? Have such a huge fantasy element to them. You know what I mean?\nTristram: Yeah.\nRobin: all sorts of nonsense and then trying to make the world make that true for them, which is why I think the ideology thing is such a good point. It’s like ideologies are so defining.\nI found this in the way that like Elon Musk complains about population decline in the US but none of his solutions make any sense, right? it’s so hard to figure out why the hell these people who presumably have an education and claim to be really smart can continually seem to be making such obvious, logical errors.\nYou know what you’re talking about it’s there’s Musk, there’s loads of stuff that loads of people think he’s really smart and they think he’s a genius until you are actually an engineer. It’s that thing about, if you read an article in a publication in your area you realize how inaccurate it is, and then everything else you hear, you think it’s accurate still, right?\nTristram: Yeah, so that’s the gelman amnesia effect.\nRobin: Exactly. And that’s what baffles me about\nTristram: is it really baffling or is it that people will latch onto an ideology that already confirms what they already know to be true? If you’ve got a religion that says that. You are, you’re okay. You are born into the right thing. You are the right people. You’ve got the right [00:45:00] tribe.\nPeople who are outside your tribe are wrong. That’s extremely persuasive. That’s extremely easy to be loved into. And if you’ve got something like effective altruism, which confirms your existing belief that you didn’t pay anyone anything, you should try to squeeze everyone around you for all the money, and you save it all.\nThat’s perfectly aligned because you will perhaps notionally save the money for some hypothetical future where you’ll be able to save a billion, billion people. And therefore, what you’re doing is ethical. That’s extremely convenient that it aligned with the values you already had. You didn’t have to change your mind about anything.\nRobin: Yeah. But the thing about I, I don’t think following the money gets you there is because the fundamental thing about AI is that so many people who have invested so much hopeless dead ends, right? Like that’s the thing about it is like Elon Musk said, the only possible way to justify Tesla’s share price if. Become self-driving cars, right? that would explode the company’s value. And the share price would be justified. the only reason why people pay that amount in Elon Musk’s, whatever is because they believe that might happen or that will happen. And it’s not going to\nTristram: no, I, this is is this a post hoc argument? It’s just like circular argument. It’s rubbish.\nLet, we must close this topic down and I will finish by looping us back to the idea of planet two space explosion and so forth\nI forget who said this, everybody should go to space.\nNot everyone should return,\nRobin: We’ll go from a conversation about terrible things to do with ai into good ai, I believe is what you’re gonna tell us about, isn’t it? Tris?\nTristram: Yes. And I do hope the listeners stick with me for this. Don’t immediately say off. It should be very obvious by now that I’m an extreme AI skeptic. I made a t-shirt that said, don’t talk to me about ai. Like it should be very obvious. However, there are plenty of good uses for.\nLarge language models, and they’re all to do with very specific language features and so forth. Here is one that was impressed upon me by Amos. I’m sure they won’t mind me saying this, Amos from Faster Than Limea really good YouTuber and much better than I article writer. And now my collaborator ammos did a little bit of tweaking the website whilst I could see their shared screen.\nAnd what Ammos was doing was using the Z editor combined with copilot like you can do, and did a little bit of what we would call derogatory vibe coding on the website. These were like some low level tweaks, like change this name everywhere, like small refactorings, like almost doesn’t need AI to code.\nBut this was like just we were doing something else and this was a really low priority thing. So fine, not my cup of tea, but it was okay. Here is where it astounded me. Ammos was using voice typing to instruct copilot inside of Zed. What to do. And this made me realize that actually there is a good use here.\nRobin: Can I\nTristram: be\nRobin: can I jump in for a second and\nTristram: please\nRobin: a point of clarification. I know what copilot is.\nTristram: So Zed is a relatively modern new programming editor. It’s got the two main features that come to the front of my mind when I think about Z is one.\nRobin: I,\nTristram: written in HTML and electron like VS. Code is, it’s written in native rust, which makes it extremely fast.\nLike you think vs. Code is nippy enough, but that’s because we’re used to it. The speed is a feature.\nRobin: okay.\nTristram: the second one is that it’s AI first. they’ve got a big AI plan and it’s why I didn’t really take it seriously because as I’ve said, I’m an AI skeptic, but the ability for you to say things like change all of these functions so that they’re wrapped in this other module and then go, if I was typing that it’s less compelling ’cause I’m having to type into an AI coding chat box.\nBut if I’m speaking that. Suddenly we’re doing something that I couldn’t do. And what that thing is, program using my voice, and this is something that recently has become all too important for me as I get RSI which is that ligament problem you have where typing hurts it’s like carpal tunnel that sort of thing.\n’cause last year or maybe two years ago, I got RSI in my fingers, hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, both sides, because I was doing too much, perhaps pottering in my digital garden. I’m joking. That wasn’t the problem. The problem was that I was working for 18 hours all day, every day because I was self-employed.\nAnd you can just blur the lines between business and pleasure. And I really just loved what I was doing. So it seemed like pleasure until six months in my body was like, Hey bro, we are not doing this anymore. So I’m doing much better because I have been lifting weights. That’s my tip for anyone listening [00:50:00] is just go to the gym, lift some weights, buy some weights, lift them.\nThat’s it. that’s all you need to do. At least it worked for me.\nRobin: the\nTristram: I’m not a doctor,\nRobin: this is\nTristram: blah, blah.\nRobin: tangent, but is the RSI in the wrist or where is it?\nTristram: Fingers, hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, bilateral, catastrophic, both sides. Whole arm. Like I’ve got tennis, elbow and wrist and finger problem. Like it was, it happened all at once. Make ’cause my body was like, Hey, you’re not listening to us, so we’re gonna set everything on fire.\nPlease stop working so hard.\nRobin: Wow.\nTristram: yeah, real nightmare. And I’ll be real with you. it is not an overstatement or an exaggeration to say that my A DHD meds gave me RSI. Now that is not, nobody should take away that you shouldn’t take a DHD meds or that they are dangerous.\nBut the line is very clear. A DHD meds allow you to work and focus on what you would like a little easier. That’s wonderful. But what I wanted to do was sit in front of my computer 18 hours a day and type and that is a real problem. Do be careful everyone. Don’t be stupid like your Uncle Tris.\nRobin: I feel like I could divert into a topic psychology that I’m very interested in, but I won’t do it.\nTristram: That’s very generous of you.\nRobin: time.\nTristram: Write it in our notes right now. Robin. Type it in, put ’em in for the next time. So I will turn to Zed and copilot and voice typing. here I had something that I could continue programming and hell probably anything, any kind of text I wasn’t using.\nIt’s a tool that you don’t need to use the generative part of it, you can be extremely prescriptive, but it’s a human computer interface. We already had solved voice recognition like in the nineties. Voice recognition had got to the point where it was great and we’ve now solved the comprehension for simple things.\nYou can’t with copilot. Get it to do complex work, complex refactoring, once your program gets to a certain level of complexity, I have been extremely unimpressed with what I’ve seen, but I’m not talking about that. Those are the problems. If things break down at high levels of complexity, but I’m not trying to replace that.\nI’m just trying to replace typing for the days when I can’t type. Now those are few and far between these days, but being really prescriptive and saying things like those three paragraphs, move them down five lines comment them all out this would be too low level if you were to do this like day to day.\nThis is not what people want with vibe coding. They want make me a website that does x really high level maximum result and that doesn’t work very well, at least after the first prototype. Once you start refining nightmare because you are getting more specific and less general. And LLMs love being general and hate being specific because they’ve not been trained on specifics.\nOr rather they have been trained on specifics but they’ve averaged it out and ground it down into this perfect sphere of unimpressive bullshit. But if you are being very specific and it’s like having that intern who doesn’t really know anything about what they’re doing, but they’re very enthusiastic and they will try to help you wherever they can for somebody who can’t type.\nThat is genius.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/3/","title":"Beginnings, Digital Gardens and AI Delusions"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/4/":{"body":"\n\nRobin talks about the perils of Unit Testing, Tris gives advice to new creators, and both reminisce about The Good Old Days and realise they never left.\n\n📖 CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 The old internet\n26:43 Unit Testing and Calcified Codebases\n42:35 The dangers of being a YouTuber\n\n🔗 LINKS\nOurs\n\nhttps://robinwinslow.uk\nhttps://noboilerplate.org\nhttps://lostterminal.com\nhttps://modemprometheus.com\nhttps://phosphenecatalogue.com\n\nExternal\n\nRuby on Rails\n37signals\nHEY.com\nBrotli (Wikipedia)\nCory Doctorow\nObsidian\nAral Balkan’s “What is the Small Web?”\n\nNote: He doesn’t call it “Web Zero” as Robin suggested.

It was probably about 2005, wasn’t it?\nTris: I dunno. I don’t wanna be, uh, you know, old man shouts to cloud about it. I watched the keynote to Rails World 2024 by David Meyer Hanson, the creator of Ruby on Rails. And it wasn’t intentionally a call to action, but it felt to me personally, like a call to action.\nUh, DHH was saying how you don’t have to use any of the bullshit that modern web development. Is lumbered with, you don’t have to bundle and compile all of your JavaScript. You don’t have to bundle and compile all of your CSS. You don’t have to use a complex reactive framework to compose, uh, reactive HTML components and then render them out into HTML.\nYou can just have some HTML with simple templating. Some JavaScript with native modules, native methods, and some native CSS, which now has enormous. Functionality in the actual old internet, we didn’t have a lot of the features like CSS variables and the ability to have more complex native functionality.\nWe had to use pre-process for everything. The latest version of JavaScript hadn’t got to all of the browsers. So what DHH was saying with all this is that if you were satisfied with web development 10 years ago, all of that is now native in the browser today. You are the front end or the front ender of the two of us.\nDoes that ring true to you?\nRobin: Right. After having actually watched this video, I think I remember you talking about it in our chat group and there were a bunch of things I hadn’t realized Were now native, right? The nesting of CSS. So to me that was one of the big powerful things that SAS gave you. And I, I have the impression that lots and lots of people are still doing it with SaaS under the assumption that.\nYou can’t do it natively, but it works natively. As in if you want to have like a an H one inside a section and you want to give the section some sky styles and then you want to give the H one some styles, you can just nest the H one tag inside the section tag. Right.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: Which you, you, you never used to be able to do and you needed, you needed SaaS for,\nTris: this is exactly what I’m talking about.\nLike we’ve forgotten or we’ve not tried. The native functionality of the browser is even as web developers, we’ve just assumed that we’ve always used these meiers and bundlers and compilers, so we always will have to. Now, there are plenty of future functionality. That we still might want to use compilers and bundlers for, but DHH is like, we’ve reached this threshold, this watershed moment where you, for 99% of websites don’t need any of that.\nYou can just write like the old days, some HTML, some JavaScript and some CSS, native CSS, his example. Was at 37 Signals they’ve recently built last couple of years. They’ve recently built hey.com, which I think is like email for people with A DHD and autism, which is why I love it, and it’s really, really good.\nHe made a wild statement at In This Rails World keynote. He said, the JavaScript we write is the JavaScript that your browser receives. It’s a one-to-one. There’s no like line framework. Yeah, there’s no framework but there, but there’s not even any bundling up. So if you get an error on line five, it’s actually line five on the developer’s machine as well as in production.\nYeah. Like it’s line five of this file. Yeah. Which is wonderful.\nRobin: I’ve always wanted that and I’ve always been frustrated by all of these different tricks that people use to try and optimize their their HTML putting like JavaScript at the end and all this kind of thing. And I was excited when HTTP two came along because.\nOn the face of it, it looked like it was going to solve a lot of that stuff because, well, first of all, you can. Hold a connection open and it will send stuff through it, and then also you can write your framework so that it will bundle the resources needed by a webpage along with the webpage. It turned out, in fact, the configuration of all of that to work really neatly was quite difficult.\nIt might be that since I was looking into it, it’s actually got smarter, but I always felt that there was a significant value in literally just sending people. The most readable form of the JavaScripts and all that kind of thing because everything now is probably compressed with bro anyway, when it’s sent over an HTP connection.\nAnd what is that? Oh, uh, you are aware that like HTP traffic used to be gzipped, but broley is the more modern compression algorithm rather than gzipped. So browsers send a pretty standard exception coding set. So it’s a sort of hierarchical set of encodings that accept, and I think it’s now basically the same across all browsers.\nAnd it has broadly as the top. Most recommended compression algorithm, which is [00:05:00] therefore presumably what most servers support as well. Gotcha. And when you compress like a file with a bunch of spaces in it, you make it a lot smaller in these compression algorithms. Mm. It’s never gonna be as good. This is the thing, it depends how obsessed you are with performance because while all these things have definitely made it a lot better, if you really obsess over it and you totally minify your JavaScript so that it replaces your variable names with single character ones and everything, that is always gonna be a little bit smaller.\nAnd if you like bundle up your JavaScript and you put it in exactly the right place in the HTML so that it requests it at just the right moment or whatever, if you really obsess over it, you’re definitely going to squeeze more. Performance out of it, but it might well be, and maybe this is what DHH was saying, that we’ve got to a point where it really doesn’t matter anymore.\nYou don’t need to do that because the baseline way that it handles it is good enough. I believe so.\nTris: Well, that’s my takeaway from the video is that we used to bundle all of our, say JavaScript into a single file and then minify it and then send it across the line. But you get so close to the same level of compression by doing nothing today.\nSo just don’t do anything and what you will get for your payment of a very slight increase in bundle size, or rather in request response size, is you will get the old internet back and unlocked. You will allow the people viewing your website. To kind of poke around and see what you were doing and learn what you were doing and say, oh, this is very cool.\nI like what they’re doing here. Lemme just look at the source code here. Open up the inspector, see what’s going on. And it’s not garbage. Minified. Yeah. Challenging to, to, to use. It’s the old. Internet, which is how you and I, I suspect how we learned HTML, JavaScript and CSS by pulling apart the source code of websites that we were seeing and going, oh, what are they doing here?\nLemme have a little look here. That’s certainly how I learned front end. How about you?\nRobin: Yeah, no, I completely agree. Like for me, becoming a web developer, it was so magical. To discover that it was all just H TM L text and these other things, right, that you could very easily understand. You could very easily imagine that you could just open up in Notepad and write your own version and then send, send it to a browser and it would display as this magical website.\nAnd I just absolutely loved it. It’s interesting. I didn’t think that was what you were going to mean by the old internet, because the other interpretation of the old internet would be sort of like internet one, right? Like before, before everything was dynamic. Glitzy single page application.\nMm.\nWhich is a bit related, but it’s not quite the same point.\nYes, you are. You are talking about the internet that is inspectable, like readable. It’s all the same. Yeah,\nTris: it’s all the same. I wanted to get on onto that for sure. Mm. I I was hoping that maybe you and I could brainstorm what we mean by the old internet and I’ll start immediately, like the best kind of the web today with today’s technology.\nKeeping all of the good things that we’ve lost because the whole internet at the moment is five websites with screenshots of the other four. What have we lost,\nRobin: stolen installment from Cory Doc, I think.\nTris: Is that Cory Doc? Oh my God. Ah, that’s so good. Such a good turn of Frank. Yeah. But like things like URLs actually working instead of a web app, that the URL never changes and it’s just like this dynamic single page thing that never moves around.\nLike URLs are great. I love URLs. You love URLs? Yeah. URLs are fantastic. Absolutely. They give us, as consumers of the website so much power.\nRobin: Yeah. And this is what Obsidian is trying to be built around. I love. Like writing, since I arrived at my new company, I’ve written there’s probably more documentation than than anyone there has ever written before.\nUm, and as I do it, I’m like adding links all over the place. And this is also what I do when I’m like reviewing pull requests, right? I’ll describe in quite minute detail why I think a different structure for this class would be better. And then I’ll link over to a Wikipedia article about a particular concept.\nAnd I think just. Enriching the meaning of what you are writing with a link off to another place that has other information. It’s just so cool and it’s the thing that the web fundamentally gave us that you never had before. But before we move on from it, I do really want to say that this thing that you are saying about the fact that there’s a value to just being able to open your JavaScript and just be able to read it exactly as it was written, is something that I have cared about deeply.\nI’ve so struggled to find anybody around me in web development teams that also cares about it, right? Like it’s the fundamental open source ness of the internet, isn’t it? It’s that anybody can just open it. You can go view source, and it will make sense to you if you just get past the fact that there’s some weird angle brackets here and there.\nYeah.\nAnd it’ll make sense to you unless somebody’s gone and done the stupid thing of like making it all into a one line document with like, yes. You know? Like, yeah,\nTris: as you say, it’s naturally open source. If I’ve got an app on my phone, it’s completely opaque to me. Like I can use it, but it’s just this blob of application and even a developer cannot.\nOr like a security researcher, like [00:10:00] someone who has the best knowledge of like disassembly and how to get into the internals of these things just can’t really give you much. You can like pull out some strings, pull out a bit of information, but nothing really, and that’s all by design. Whereas the web is view source by design.\nYeah. Which is just gorgeous.\nRobin: Yeah. I think I particularly remember getting into arguments about this when people were raving about web assembly. And I was saying. It’s great in all. Mm-hmm. But a big downside is the fact that it’s hiding away from you. A binary.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: Right. And you can’t, you can no longer tell how a thing is written or what’s going on.\nYes.\nTris: Yeah. Uh, probably you were talking to me because I would’ve been talking about rust and web assembly and how it’s fantastic, but you sure can’t view source. You have to rely on the social contract of open source software where you present. The user with a binary, and you also say, here is the source code for this binary you’re looking at.\nIt’s not as tight as just, Hey, here’s the source. Yeah, your browser will run this.\nRobin: I was just trying to find these websites. It seemed to have disappeared. But the other thing that you could mean by the old internet is, so there’s this concept called the lean web. Which doesn’t seem to exist as much as it used to, or I just can’t find it.\nAnd then our role, Balkan,\nmm-hmm.\nCoined this phrase Web Zero, which sort of means the same thing ish. It’s all this point that single page applications are over engineered. They obscure everything away from you. They try and. Reimplement things that Browse already does. Yes. Uh, and now suddenly every webpage is like 10 megabytes and it’s using up everyone’s bandwidth and it makes everything slower.\nAnd you need all this CPU to be able to run all the complicated JavaScript frameworks. Mm-hmm. And it’s also related to, Corey talks about this very powerfully, he calls it the surveillance lag. Mm-hmm. Every time you load a webpage, it then has to like. Load all the ad tracking stuff before it can do anything useful.\nAh, and then he describes it as, what am I bid for? You know, one Tris Osen and he goes and does it. But yeah, like fundamentally, because we have this surveillance capitalism world, it means that every web developer now has to include all of these tools. So the first thing talking about Web Zero, ’cause I’ve always tried to write my website as simply as possible.\nAnd if you go and look at it, hopefully you’ll see that it’s as simple as possible and the big. Decision that was difficult to make, but once I made it, I felt a lot lighter was not to include Google Analytics or any equivalent client side analytics tracker.\nMm-hmm.\nBecause you should, in theory, be able to track that purely based on server side logs, right?\nYou don’t need Yes, exactly. You shouldn’t need to be hijacking the reader’s computer. To make them do extra compute and send off extra requests to random websites so that you can see that they saw your page.\nTris: No, indeed, and it’s not just random websites, it’s 98% of the internet is sending telemetry tracking data to Google.\nMm. That’s the real problem, technically a problem for the users of the website that you are causing them to be a little bit slow. That’s the technical problem. The moral problem is participating in global surveillance.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: Horrifying. When I worked at the UK Government Digital Service, we had to upgrade from an old version of Google Analytics to a new version of Google Analytics on some site, and I was like setting my desk on fire virtually to say, how about we don’t, how about we upgrade to nothing?\nHow about we upgrade to not opting in to Google surveillance of the population of the United Kingdom when they’re trying to just like find out some tax law or some benefits laws or like whatever. Like it’s just seemed unbelievably immoral to me. And even then in an environment with really smart people who care about privacy, I was not able to do it.\nYeah. That, because the answer is Google have a monopoly on analytics, and if you want analytics, you have to use Google, and no one else is even in the game really.\nRobin: But what they’re actually doing isn’t very complicated. It’s not like one of these other things where there’s some kind of monopoly of scale or network effects where actually you could send your analytics anywhere and you’d still get a nice graph that tells you what you want to know, right?\nLike there’s nothing particularly special. The only thing about Google Analytics is that it’s free.\nTris: Agree, there is something you’re missing every. Analytics platform and third party service has an integration with Google Analytics and assumes it’s the default, doesn’t have any integration with your weird analytics that you’ve just built.\nIt’s all Google Analytics focused and the analyst, like somebody who is like specialist in this, feels that they are trained. To be an expert in Google Analytics. I’ve never found an expert in Google\nRobin: Analytics in my whole career.\nTris: [00:15:00] I delicately agree with you. I believe, I use the expression feels that they are yes, an expert like change.\nSo changing that fundamentally changes their job they feel. Um, on encapsulate.com, perhaps you do the same on your site. Robin winslow.uk. We use CloudFlare and we use CloudFlare logs, which are entirely server side. Or rather, they’re not on the client’s machine. They’re all the, the DNS level and I, they don’t give you such rich analytics as Google does.\nLike how many times did they use a mouse over this or give a heat map of where they were clicking and looking firstly, that’s gross. Secondly, no one is ever, in my experience of people do using their software, giving me anything useful to do with that. Do you get 99% of the way there with. What pages are users going to?\nRobin: This could take us in a tangential direction, which could be a future topic perhaps, which is about just the. The tendency to just collect data for the sake of it, right? Mm-hmm. The theory is that you will look at the heat map data and you will use it to understand your users better, so you know that they’re scrolling this far down the page, they’re seeing this thing over here, and maybe some of the time it does get used for that usefully in some kind of way.\nBut really what they’re trying to replace is like a good old fashioned user study where you actually deliberately go and observe your users using your website and note down what it is they get up to. Yeah. And those are really valuable, I believe, in usability research. I think it’s a very good thing, certainly, but I think this is a very poor man’s shadow version of it, and I think it tends not to lead to very good optimizations, but people collect the data in case it can help and there’s so much.\nThat gets collected in that way, but I’m not gonna go too far down that track. It’s absolutely, it’s a diversion.\nTris: I’ll bring us back. I’ll bring us back to the original topic by saying that you don’t find the needles easier by making the haystack bigger. Yeah. And that’s what these tools do. Yeah. It’s incredible.\nBack to Web Zero, was it, you said? Although the old internet? Yeah. The reason I’m bringing this up is that I have a draft video. Called Welcome back to the internet. It’s my current draft. After speaking with you today. I might call it view source, but I think maybe the first one is good for that, or maybe the thumbnail can just be a stylized view source.\nThat could be, that could be quite good. Yeah. I like both. Yes, I’ve noted them down and thank you, but there’s such a movement at the moment. In fact, the movement has gone so far as to there. There are some people who say, we need to forget the current web. Let’s make a new one. You might have heard of the Gemini Project, which is based on Gopher, or inspired by Gopher, which is just, you can think of it as a markdown browser, so really restricted syntax, just like seven things, bold, italic headings.\nLists and numbered lists, that sort of thing. And a text a, a fairly plain text browser and it’s got links and it’s got embedded images and that’s it. That’s your lot. No CSS, which the creators perceive as being unnecessary Complexity, certainly no JavaScript, which we all might agree is often unnecessary complexity, but I think that actually goes too far.\nI think that belies a misunderstanding that we don’t have to throw away all of the web. To get back to the old web. There are communities like neo cities.org who are bringing back the old web. It sounds like. I hear you laughing. It sounds like you know neo cities.\nRobin: Yeah, I mean like Neo cities is obviously a nostalgia project.\nCertainly. Which I think is, it’s nice, but it’s not where we’re going ’cause it’s where we’ve been and whatever comes in the future is gonna look a bit different. But I completely agree with you that I certainly hope that there’s a significant appetite for just rejecting all of the. Glitzy bullshit, pr, marketing, fanciness of these modern websites that are actually like stealing all your bandwidth and your CPU time and tracking you, surveilling you and trying to manipulate you, stealing your attention and all this kind of stuff.\nAnd I think everybody will relate to that message on some level. You know, you sit down on the sofa, you wake up an hour and a half later and you are like. Why did I just start doom scrolling? I didn’t want to. So I think that some level, there really is a huge movement of people that are really frustrated with this system.\nTris: Yeah, I think the message that I, I hope to give over with this video, welcome back to the internet, is that all of the, the good parts. It didn’t go away. They weren’t replaced. We just chose to use Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and IT and the app ecosystem. Now you might say that we were guided there by the delicate hand of Google and Apple who encourage this sort of closed, yeah, this closed approach.\nHowever, the old internet is still there. Email. Is still available. Websites, blogs, messaging apps [00:20:00] such as Telegram that use a real API and don’t clock you in. And you can use third party apps. You can make a watch app like it’s just as Wild West as it was in the nineties. And even Firefox for the moment is still here.\nYou don’t have to buy into. Google’s domination of the front end of this, all of the browser. And as we discovered, they have recently enacted their 15 year plan, which is disabling the ability to install an ad blocker because they now feel that they are so. Well secure in their domination of the landscape.\nThey’re so sure of themselves. Mm. You can just download new browser. It’s not legal. You can just have Firefox. I\nRobin: fear that’s kind of true though, that they have won the domination. Like if we are really serious about this. Right. Okay. So I was aware in let’s say 2010 uhhuh, that there was a battle going on.\nWhere mobile operating systems were trying to come in and replace the internet as the fundamental place for application development. Mm-hmm. And that this was the risk is that it it, it was a power grab by the companies that control my mobile phone operating systems. And at the time, I think I was probably young and naive enough to reassure myself that they weren’t gonna win for this reason or that reason, but I think they did win.\nIf you think of it from the perspective of a mobile phone, right? We know that mobile devices are what most people use across the world.\nMm-hmm.\nAnd on a mobile device, just think about the experience of using most web products versus an app. Mm-hmm. And it’s like, it’s been so impoverished, the web experience.\nThat you’d kind of be crazy to expect that somebody would prefer to use webpages over a native app at this point. I feel\nTris: that is true, and we must fight to get away from it. Yeah, but the way is very clear. I run Firefox on my phone, quite a lot of the web apps that I use, sorry. Quite a lot of the mobile apps that are running on my phone are actually just a skinned browser.\nThey’re just electro. I know.\nRobin: I know.\nTris: And so actually there’s no resistance. To getting a web version of that app because we actually, it’s just written, but\nRobin: it’s just, the thing is that because they run the os, they’ve got the ability to make things so annoying for you. So for example, right. There really is nothing better about the YouTube app than about YouTube through Firefox.\n’cause I also run Firefox on my, on my phone. And in fact there are massive benefits to running YouTube on Firefi. You subscribe to YouTube, so you probably don’t experience this pain. I don’t subscribe to YouTube. I\nTris: do not subscribe to\nRobin: YouTube. Oh you don’t? Oh, okay. I get adverts. Okay, cool. Well then you are, um, yeah, if you run it in Firefox, you can swipe away Firefox and then you can swipe down from the top and you can press play in your little, you know, the little kind of like media is playing box that appears on your notifications.\nAnd then it will play in the background. And not only will it play in the background, it now won’t include adverts.\nTris: Yes, I did know that. Yeah, you can just play it in Firefox, hit the home screen and it plays in the background mark. Right.\nRobin: But still, it’s a really annoying experience. I’ll be in the YouTube app.\nI’ll try and open a video and I will say open in Firefox and it will open Firefox and it’ll switch right back to YouTube because Firefox will remember that it’s supposed to use the YouTube app. There’s just so many 10 drills that try to push you and force you into the native app experience that it just feels like it’s so hard to.\nPersuade people to do anything else, you know?\nTris: Yes. But not impossible. Yeah. Yeah. I was there as I’m, as I believe you were in 2004 when Firefox 1.0 came out. And everyone who downloaded, maybe on the first day or in the first week or before it hit a million downloads or something like that, got a, uh, novelty PDF certificate that said, thank you for making Firefox possible, or something like that.\nAnd I still have that PDFI should print it out and display it proudly.\nRobin: You should, yeah. Make a poster out of it.\nTris: I’m telling you this because we have been here before. You and I, and many of our listeners grew up in the absolute domination of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, which is now a punchline and a joke and an afterthought.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: We are in a better place at the moment than we were then because Firefox already exists, so I believe we can get back there. The cycle of the wheel of history can keep turning.\nRobin: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I, I think particularly with ai, there will come a point at least where the new generation completely rejects.\nThat whole bloated mess in some way. Oh yeah. And and it will look like the pieces that are like of the old stuff probably. And they’ll build a whole new movement out of it. And I’m done. I’m totally there for it. I guess I’m a bit jaded at this point.\nTris: Yeah. I mean, it sounds like you should go work for Ruby on Rails or 37 Signals or something that [00:25:00] sounds like it’ll be a perfect match for you.\nThe subtitle of the video of DHHS Rails World Video to bring it all back home Yeah. Is it’s fun to be competent. And that comes from a halfway through the video where DHH said, when you are building real JavaScript instead of JavaScript, which is maybe in a different framework that makes things different, not better or worse, just different.\nAnd when you are writing real CSS, not some pre-processing framework, and when you’re writing real HTML, not some component framework or I’m not sure if he mentioned utility CSS, um. Like tailwind, but it was definitely hinting at it. Instead of learning all of those frameworks, you can just learn HTML, JavaScript and CSS because it’s fun.\nTo be competent. It’s fun to actually do it yourself. Yeah. If you are a backend developer, it’s fun to learn a bit of JavaScript ’cause it’s not the nineties JavaScript’s great. And more importantly, the browser is really great.\nRobin: Yeah, I think, I mean, what you’re kind of hinting at there is, I’m talking about the social problem of the fact that these, these monopolies have won, they control the population basically at this point.\nWhat I hear in your response is we need to win back the hearts and minds of the people who are building the tools. I think that’s exactly right. That’s the way to do it. You remember that being a web developer in the two thousands was inspiring, right? And in a way that that has just gone, nobody is now proud to be working for Google or working for Meta, or working for like, they’re just not.\nNo. And that’s got a huge opportunity in it, I hope. I hope so too.\nUnit Testing and Calcified Codebases\nRobin: I’ve been a little bit obsessing about this testing thing ’cause it’s come up a couple of times at work. I think that the development community has gone through a significant evolution when it comes to testing code bases, uhhuh. The original version of testing that is very useful for a technical system is functional testing where you define your functional requirements.\nAnd then you make sure your requirements are met. That could be done completely manually. You’ve written down a document where you say it needs to do this, and then you have somebody click through the system and just say, yeah, it does that,\nTris: right? You might even find in a, like a government contract, you might have acceptance criteria for the contract.\nRobin: Right. Exactly. Exactly. So then unit testing is a very old term, and it started right back at the beginning of software development. I mean, apparently the first recorded usage of it is in 1956. It was in the US Navy’s Symposium on advanced programming methods for digital computers. That’s it. Then the SAGE Project and the Mercury Project.\nThis was at the point of program development where we’re still like using punch cards and things like that. It was a revolution where you were starting to build. A system that might actually make use of pieces that might have been written in a couple of different teams. We can have a test that will make sure the thing that team is providing actually definitely works before we use it in this other system.\nSo unit in its original meaning had this enabling modularity philosophy behind it. Right now it’s my feeling that that’s not what people understand unit testing to mean anymore. The TDD movement became a cudgel to beat people with. There are a lot of code bases around that have been weighed down by the tests.\nChanging anything will break everything all over the place. If I move this hair over to the left two centimeters, then the whole thing’s gonna collapse, so I’m not gonna do it. We agree that what I believe is the spirit of the original meaning of the term unit test. We should be testing at the interface.\nMm-hmm. If you write a system, you want it to have tests that are checking, that the actual promises are met. A simple version would be testing an API, but API has a very clearly written API specification that says you can make a post request over here. It has these parameters, you’ll get this in response.\nThese are the status codes you can expect back, et cetera. Right. And that is then something that’s very, very easy to test and the best version. Of a fully tested code base would be an API, where you’ve written tests that cover every single one of these specified endpoints that you’re supposed to be delivering and make sure that they all pass.\nSo one reason why you might want a tune test at a lower level would be because there’s an internal module. So for example, you might have a model layer that transforms model objects into database reads and database rights. At that point, you might say, we’re gonna formally define its interface to say it provides these different model classes, and they all have these different.\nActions you can take on them. Once you’ve then formalized that, now you can write tests around that which make sure that that model layer absolutely works right. The thing that frustrates me over and over again is I see people writing tests very deep in the application, so they’re using a whole load of internal.\nPrivate stuff. Yeah, private stuff. And every single little function is coupled to another test. So I think two software engineers this shift in thinking would make a huge difference. Now, I [00:30:00] originally brought this topic to you mm-hmm. As a sort of criticism of test driven development, and we got into a little bit of a back and forth.\nYeah. Because you’ve had a very good experience with test of development and you, I sure have, think that your version of test of development is not incompatible with what I’m saying. Is that right?\nTris: Yes, absolutely. Yeah. The testing of the interface, the tests that run on CI and run on the server, like the tests that you share with your colleagues are very different to the tests that you write throughout your use of TDD in your discipline of writing code.\nA lot of the tests that you write as part of your. Red green refactor cycle. As you zoom in and hone in on the exact functionality that you intend to change, you intend to write. A lot of those are transient artifacts. They’re almost like compiled artifacts that are on your machine. They’re not, you’re not gonna commit them back up.\nNo. No one else cares about those. They helped you do your job, and when they’re done, you discard them. They are not necessarily. At the level of the interface, which would be a good test to, a good unit test to check in. They are whatever level that makes sense to you. Maybe as you said, those coders that you’ve experienced, like coding way too low level or inside the private interfaces of modules or whatever, those are actually perfectly fine for TDD or they can be perfectly fine for TDD, but you don’t check them in\nRobin: if you are gonna stop.\nWith that attitude then wouldn’t a reasonable next step be to say, since I’ve written this test that tests this internal object that doesn’t matter to the external interface of this thing, why wouldn’t I check it in? Because what happens when I then want to evolve it later and I already have a test that could help me to do it?\nTris: Like the high level test should actually be testing what you’re actually trying to do. If you are not there yet, you can kind of get there.\nRobin: Yeah. What I thought you were gonna say about TDD was that you transformed the test. So you’ll start by writing the smallest part of your solution, right? You’ll write a little bit of code and it will fail.\nThen you go and you change it a bit and it’ll pass, and you go back and you change your test and it’ll fail. And through the process of changing the test, you eventually end up at the. Interface test, but I think that’s not what you just said, so maybe you don’t think that that would happen.\nTris: I’m not sure if there are exactly hard and fast rules, and I think that in terms of like choosing the correct level of obstruction for your unit tests, it’s extremely tied to experience.\nWhat you described as getting frustrated that there were a lot of unnecessary tests down at the low level. It seems to me the difference between a senior or lead developer who has an understanding of like the whole system versus a junior or me or a lower experienced developer who is coming at it from the bottom up.\nHere’s a function. And then this function calls another function. They’ve got to like navigate their way up the abstraction layers, whereas someone who is more experienced sees the whole thing and sees, oh, well this is where you should put your tests very obviously. Whereas if you’re in the weeds, if you’re down in the if foundations of the program in the functions, then.\nYou might not choose the right level due to experience.\nRobin: Okay, so there’s two things that I want to focus on there. One is I don’t know that this is a junior, senior problem per se. I’ve definitely had lots of poor requests from experienced developers who are testing things that are far lower level than I think they should be.\nI think that it is a thing that you see juniors do more. But I think the reason you see juniors do it more is because it’s what they were taught, and then you only get the confidence to challenge the status quo when you’re a bit more senior. That would be the only way that I’d say it. It has a junior, senior cadence, because I would say that overall everybody, a junior or senior developer should ideally be handed a user story, right?\nThey should ideally be handed a thing to solve that tells you what you are actually trying to change on the behavior of the whole system. The first thing to do is to say, what test would I then write? The test you would write is the thing that tests that the system has changed. I don’t think that it’s nuanced.\nI don’t think that it’s a thing that you can only learn with experience. I think it, it is sometimes difficult to hold the two perspectives in your head. You’re changing something in a small function and the actual effect is this outside effect. I don’t think choosing the level at which to do your test is nuanced.\nI think it is quite clear whether you’re testing from the interface level or you’re testing beneath it personally. And I think, and I think if you think it’s nuanced, then you might be not. Basically following the maxim that I’m trying to suggest that people should be following to make sure that the thing [00:35:00] is well tested and efficiently tested.\nRight. Do you see what I mean? Mm-hmm. ’cause I think the outside is obvious. Like with any, what is the maxim? Can you state it? Oh, tests from the interface, right? Interface tests. Well, I would’ve called it, right? Interface tests. Don’t write unit tests because I think what unit tests have now become. Is this sort of low level test, but that’s not very clear because I think the actual definition of unit test is more fuzzy.\nBut it would be write tests at the interface and only write ’em against something that can be said to be a formal interface. I like it. You should write the book. I buy it. Oh, good. Good. Oh, well I’m glad you agree with it. I suppose if I was a little braver, I might press a bit harder on its compatibility with TDD, but I know that we had a, you know, I mean, do you really throw away, um,\nTris: what’s the refactor part of red green refactor?\nYou are, you are refactoring your tests. You are refactoring your code, and so you’re not like deleting files. You are just evolving them and evolving them, and evolving them, and eventually your code is written up to the interface and the test is written up to the interface.\nRobin: Oh, so you are saying it eventually transforms into an interface test\nTris: It Can I, I’m not.\nSaying so, so strongly, right. I’m not sure if that is a, if that is a rule.\nRobin: The thing, well, I certainly am familiar with the fact that in every piece of development I would be trying out stuff. I would be checking it in the ways that I want to check it, and then the process I’ve gone through to do that.\nVery often bears only a vague resemblance to the PRI eventually submit. Right. That’s pretty common. Hmm. So I think that’s sort of what you’re saying is that you’re using, you’re using a test first approach as your discipline for creating the solution, and then there will always be a bit of a recrafting when you decide what you’re actually trying to propose into the central code base.\nTris: Yeah, absolutely. Like you might refactor your code to make it up to the standards that your team expects and uses, and you would do the same for your test.\nRobin: Yeah, you push it up, the test fail, and then you’re like, oh, I gotta run format, and then you Right. Happens so often. I’m glad that you agree with all that.\nI think maybe you don’t agree with me on the problem. I see this as a quite significant problem that I can run into every day. Do you think it’s a problem? Do you understand why? I think it’s important to focus on it? Yes.\nTris: Slowing down speed of development. Yeah, there’s a, yeah, the code coverage fixation.\nOf dynamic languages has a lot to answer for, I think.\nRobin: Yeah. But you can very easily achieve a hundred percent code coverage testing from the outside. Like I don’t think it, it precludes the idea of having a hundred percent code coverage at all.\nTris: It’s not as easy than doing it with unit tests or you doing it with bottom up tests.\nIf you’ve got five lines in a branch of a if statement that are own, that aren’t covered, it’s a lot easier to like to say,\nRobin: what function are those lines in? Yeah. And then you test the function. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nTris: It’s cheating. But it’s yes. You know, show me how, you, tell me how you measure me and I will tell you how I will behave.\nThat’s what we’re talking about here.\nRobin: Yes. Yeah, exactly. I suppose I just feel that if you could be disciplined about doing it the way I’m suggesting, that’s actually far more valuable. If you discover that you haven’t tested 5% of your application, you now have to figure out why your interface tests haven’t tested that 5%, right?\nAnd then in that process, you might decide that 5% should be just discarded. You know what I mean? Absolutely. And that’s a really good thing.\nTris: It certainly is.\nRobin: I suppose I feel that in enterprises. There are many, many code bases that just grind to a halt. They get old, they get crusty. No one knows how to run them.\nEverybody’s scared of breaking them. And then they just become this drain, this tech debt, this really complex piece. There’s like a feature request list as long as your arm, and no one’s paying attention to any of them because no one can actually work on the thing. Right? And that’s, I think, what I’m worried about, this death of code projects.\nAnd you need to keep it vibrant. You need to keep it active. And the way you do that is by keeping your tests away from. Stopping you from innovating and stopping you from changing your code. You do that by only testing the bit. You need a test, which is the actual function of the thing.\nTris: Uh, yeah, I couldn’t agree more.\nThis is why I love rust, because there’s so little to test in rust, because the code is the test for 99% of the cases that you would otherwise have to write a unit test for in a language, say like Python or JavaScript, like you don’t. Like every single rust project, the code coverage is 100%. Like it’s a compiled language.\nThere are no deadlines, there are no lines of syntax that aren’t correct. But because rusts syntax encode so much valuable information, not only do those lines compile the meaning behind them, compiles, uh, and is valid. So like I only care about interface testing at the highest level. Rust. There’s no point doing one of those classic.\nThe test basically rewrites the function and you get this one-to-one equivalence of lines of code because the compiler’s already doing that. You don’t need to worry about that. Oh, right. It’s marvelous.\nRobin: Do [00:40:00] you think that rust teams, they not. Subservient to this a hundred percent code coverage maxim, or do they do it all through the interface?\nI see so often these tests where the test is almost just a duplicate of the code that’s in the function and it’s ridiculous. And if you were to write a test for rust, it sounds like you’re basically saying you’d be doing that. You would be saying, does the code do exactly what the code does? And yet I can imagine that there would be people who would write those tests\nTris: perhaps, but you don’t have to be quite as nervous.\nWhen you’re writing in rust or indeed any compiled language, but rust takes this to an extreme. Yeah.\nRobin: But you see, to me, it’s the dogma. I feel like there’s a significant dogma around saying, if you are a professional engineer, you must be writing these tests. And I’m just curious whether you think that exists at all in Rust or whether you think it, it just doesn’t, like they’re just free from the pressure to write tests in that way.\nTris: I think it is overwhelmingly the latter that you are freed from the need to write ridiculous tests because the, okay, the compiler contract with the rich type system. Has already covered a lot of these things I’ve said before in in videos, and I believe I’ve spoken to you about it, that because Rust has the lifetime annotation system, you can describe not just what your data is, but when, which is wildly powerful.\nAnd it was built into the language so that you could describe when the data is valid so that the memory can be freed when it falls outta scope. Great. And just accidentally made this. Amazing feature that people like me who kind of don’t care about low level stuff like memory, can hijack it to make type safe rules such as an order is only valid if the.\nCustomer remains valid. You can temporarily link your types like this. Mm. I would’ve had to write a unit test to test that relationship before. I’ve had to write it into four loops and if statements in the code, and then I would’ve had to write tests that involve four loops and if statements. But now I’ve got this rich type hierarchy where I can guarantee everything at the compile time.\nIt’s fricking amazing. There is no faster test than a test that is unwritten. When I hit save in my IDE, the compiler compiles, and we’re done.\nRobin: That explains why I feel this is very important and you, that you don’t seem like this is really important. And that’s clearly because you know the world you are in is simply more evolved.\nSo I’m, I’m wrestling with issues that exist in the old world before people have created these superior supply systems. I mean, you, you are correct.\nThe dangers of being a YouTuber\nTris: I’ve been meaning to open up some sort of scholarship mentoring option for. Years now. Mm. Like ever since I first started the mentoring and like within the first month or two I realized, oh no, because I’m charging so much, I’m only getting people who are very rich and who already have the means to get private mentoring.\nYeah. And this probably happens with tutors all over the world. Yes. Forever. Like the people who can afford your services are the people that can afford it. Yeah. People that really need your services will never come to you because they can’t afford it.\nRobin: Yes. I suppose, um, maybe the quintessential example is pro bono lawyers, right?\nLike as in lawyers are a fantastically expensive resource who are mostly only available to the most rich and powerful people. And then that’s why it’s kind of a well-known thing that lawyers will often do pro bono work, right? Which is where they work for free for, for people that need lawyer lawyering services.\nRight? It’s a good example. I would be very nervous about choosing to become. Particularly a YouTuber because I’m so aware that you would be at the whims of the YouTube algorithm.\nMm.\nAnd that Google nowhere near has your interests at heart. Yes. Um, and, and it will cast you aside in a moment. It just doesn’t care.\nYes. And, and, and, and you are completely at the mercy of Google’s decisions. And you have done a very good job of extracting yourself from that sort of liability by having your mentoring and having your Patreon. And I’m curious, right? I suppose my feeling was that you had started this journey, you quit your job, and then.\nIt was my impression, and you might tell me this is wrong, but it was my impression that sort of your income over the next month or two might have been about 10 or 15% less than you might have hoped, and I got the impression you were then working quite hard because you felt a little bit of that pressure.\nAnd like you said, you got RSI, you got burnout. And, and, and so I was also genuinely curious in like how comfortable you feel at this present time. ’cause I don’t think I’ve, I’ve quite had, I, I don’t think I know very clearly how, how you feel now,\nTris: right? I didn’t quit my job until I was able to get enough non YouTube income, Patreon income [00:45:00] to support my bills and food.\nBecause I wanted to be able to say, get COVID and be off, you know, not make any videos for a month or two.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: And not for that to be a catastrophe.\nRobin: Yeah. And,\nTris: and patrons like, it, it, it feels like I have a salary rather than that I have to a gig work. Yeah. Um, which is wonderful and I wish for anyone who is interested in the creator universe.\nThat’s, that, that’s marvelous. Yeah. What unlocked it for me is this the, the mentoring peers that I, that I, that I do on my, my Patreon. Yeah. That is so much money that only, yeah. Successful people were able to do it. But now, and it’s a\nRobin: subscription model. It’s not, it’s not one time mentoring. It, it, it’s like they pay this every month, they get one session every month.\nTris: Yes. That’s it. You can, you can just cancel after the first session. And people are very welcome to do that. A few people have mm-hmm. I’ve been able to answer all the questions like, we’ve blasted through it and it’s been fine. Um, but most people want like an ongoing. Relationship. No students were signing up for 250 bucks a month.\nOf course, that’s too expensive. Yes. So, so last month I was finding in the position where I could offer this concession mentoring. And so I, so for a fifth of the price, $50, I opened up just 10 slots. That’s all I could spare for my calendar. 10 slots of these, uh, scholarship mentoring is what I’m calling it for, um, students, women, and non-binary.\nUm, minoritized people and a, a few other categories like people who are underrepresented in both like the tech world and my students. Like, how can I fix that? I’ve got this very, very, this very, uh. Blunt lever, which is cost. That’s the only lever that I can change to, to, to help that. And I’ve always wanted to, like, I get emails from students all the time asking for like, if I can do, if I can do this, and I now say, I now finally can say yes.\nI always, in the past, I’ve always liked, helped people who, who, who reach out. I’m only human, but I can’t like give the time that I want because I have to. Do things that make money because of the terrible world we live in.\nRobin: Yeah. So I really like the scholarship thing. Appreciate it. But I really like the, uh, the concept and the challenge of trying to do it.\nAnd I so sort of do, I, I sort of wish I had your problem in the sense that like, well, on one level, I, I would definitely love to be making content like you do and, and, and have that be. The thing that I do that people care about. Mm-hmm. To be a thought leader, you know? Sure. That’s a be, that’s a better name than influencer, isn’t it?\nAlthough it basically means the same thing. It is.\nTris: It tri, it triggers me a lot because I once had a very nice manager who was very switched on and he very delicately after my first. Review. So Tris, you’ve, you’re, you’ve become a, a real thought leader in our team, and I’d like you to become an action leader.\nAnd that was his way of saying, do some bloody work.\nRobin: Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, that’s, no, that’s horrible. That is, that is, oh my God. Oh.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/4/","title":"Rediscovering the Old Internet, Rethinking Unit Testing, and Navigating the Creator Economy"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/5/":{"body":"\n\nTris despairs at Robin’s desk setup, Robin recommends tech/lefty podcasts, and Tris explains how he’s augmenting his Obsidian use with the open-source ecosystem.\n\n📖 CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 Intros, summer over\n01:14 Robin’s home working environment\n31:53 Robin’s leftist podcast recs\n52:25 Tris’s non-fiction podcast recs\n54:47 Demo to Robin how Tris makes his videos\n\n🔗 LINKS\n\nROBIN’S SHAMEFUL DINING TABLE SETUP:\n\n\nOurs\n\nhttps://robinwinslow.uk\nhttps://noboilerplate.org\nhttps://lostterminal.com\nhttps://modemprometheus.com\nhttps://phosphenecatalogue.com\n\nExternal\n\nScott Hanselman’s “Brain, Back, Buns, and Bites” article\nPresenterm\n\nRobin’s podcast list\n\nThe Intercept\nDrop Site News\nMacro Dose\nDeconstructed\nPolitics Theory Other\nFactually with Adam Conover\nOn the Media\nTech Policy Press\nTech Dirt\nEach Week Work Repeat\n\nTris’s podcast list\n\nSelf-Directed Research\nWB-40\nCortex\n\n🧑 CREDITS\nDecapsulate is a NAMTAO Production (namtao.com)\nIt is hosted by:\n\nTristram Oaten (https://mastodon.social/@0atman)\nRobin Winslow (https://union.place/@nottrobin)\n\nThis work is BrainMade (https://brainmade.org)\nTranscript\nIntros, summer over\nTris: Right. There we go. September, I can’t believe it. Where’s the summer gone or where’s the summer going?\nRobin: mean, it’s crazy to be, for me, obviously it, it’s, it means kids starting school.\nTris: Of course. Right. That’s exciting.\nRobin: the school holiday, summer, even if people don’t have kids, I feel like everything is oriented around school holiday, you know, in terms of what events are happening and all that\nOrganising life around academic year\nTris: Right, exactly. Yes. my heroes seem to be great organizes this year around the academic year, and I think that like ending with the summer is quite a nice, like, reset quite a nice big block of time. Although you could argue that winter also works quite well, but we we’re no longer in the Roman Empire where everything stops for four months for an enormous single month cold winter.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: so school holidays, my upcoming video, the video is called Obsidian for Students. I’ve timed it for back to school.\nRobin: Oh, wow.\nprofessional.\nMental health day\nTris: I mean, I’m trying, everyone says you’ve gotta like, get in all this and every single year I miss Mental Health Day. even though all of my podcasts and half of my videos are about mental health. Um, right.\nRobin: some strong\nTris: Uh,\nRobin: don’t you, for the lead up to that.\nRobin’s home working environment\nTris: yes, exactly. So we were gonna talk about some other stuff, but I have sneaked in an extra extra topic because you mentioned just now that you were interested in setting up a new workspace in your new house.\nRobin: Yes,\nTris: opinions. Tell me.\nRobin: Yeah. So I, sent you the photo of what my setup right now looks like, which is just that I moved into this house,\nTris: Oh.\nRobin: was full of. Furniture because it’s, um, you know, furnished place. It used to be an Airbnb, so it was like really kitted out and I’ve already shipped out a couple of beds into a storage place.\nand I just haven’t gone around to like, getting rid of this table because if I get rid of this table right now, I have nothing else to work on. But ul ultimately I think I want this room to be to be like a massive play place for the kids when I’m not working. So I kind of want a desk that is a work desk. Like I think I’ve given up on the idea of having an actual dining table in this room, which is what this table\nTris: Yeah. Gotcha.\nRobin: so I want a desk that is a work desk that I can kind of put away behind the, the door or something quite easily, um, if I need to. but otherwise, when it comes out, it’s like a proper workstation and I’ve got a proper chair a little bit of an A DHD thing. It’s\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: of the life I had I got very used to just working ad hoc wherever, so I never\nTris: Oh,\nRobin: a place to work, and now I’m\nTris: right. That’s where everyone starts.\nRobin: improve that. So I, I have very little experience in this and I wanna do it.\nTris: I must tell the listener. What I am seeing here, because this photo is, it looks like a nightmare. this is a, a dining table with like a flat top, that a weird crisscrossed are very arty, legs holding it up. that is not the worst part, the worst part of the dining chairs that are around it, they look very soft and comfortable.\nBut these are hurting my back even to look at, these are making me very sad. I do appreciate the, the microphone boom arm that, that I bullied Robin into getting. So that’s why that’s working very nicely.\nRobin: we can put the\nTris: Do IS Yeah. Yeah. As long as you’re happy with it. but yeah, we can put it in the show notes.\nThat sounds good. am I seeing a Mac wireless keyboard in front of you there? Oh my God. We will return to that,\nRobin: I’m\nTris: at least the laptop. Hmm.\nRobin: I love, like I know, I know. I think our taste in keyboards is, is very different.\nTris: Great. Great, great. I’m happy for you. it’s obvious that Apple just struck gold 20 years ago on the perfect land, and they’ve never needed to update it since. That’s so lucky for them. what fits on a tiny laptop is also perfect on the big desktop.\nRobin: the keyboard layout a different\nTris: Yeah, I agree. I agree. However, behind the keyboard, there is a, a Mac laptop on a little stand, bringing it up slightly higher, that looks a bit better.\nAnd then there’s a, a large screen off to the right,\nRobin: Yeah.\nBites, back &amp; buns\nTris: this isn’t the worst thing, but you an internet professional, a programmer, someone who probably sits here for a lot of time, real nightmare, real nightmare. I’ll tell you why I’m what made me so passionate about.\nAbout this sort of thing,There was a blog by Scott Hanselman, called Brain Bites, back and Buns, the Programmer’s Priorities.\nhe wrote this in October of 2011. And the TLDR is that if you are a programmer, That was his primary audience. But I think probably it applies to anyone who works with computers for a living brain Bites back and buns you.\nInvest in all these things. You should not be afraid to like spend real, real good money on this. [00:05:00] It’s similar to spending on your health, which everyone would recommend. You know, don’t be afraid investing in your health if you know as much as one can afford.\nRobin: Yeah. Yeah.\nTris: So the buns part is what you’re sitting on. Don’t be afraid to spend on your chair.\nTris: The back was your bed. Don’t be afraid to buy a nice, comfortable bed with a good mattress that fits you.\nRobin: Oh,\nTris: There’s nothing worse than,\nRobin: bit, because to\nTris: yeah.\nRobin: To me, sleep is the thing that you really should invest in. Like, I think I, I think I, I, I saw a quote, which I completely agreed with that it was like,\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: sleep is the solution to all problems. Basically.\nTris: Oh my God, I love that.\nI couldn’t agree more as someone who has both back problems and insomnia. I couldn’t agree more.\nRobin: but I’ve got a bit better. Yeah.\nTris: No, I’ve seen your, commit times. no, you, you don’t sleep great. so back was like bed, make sure you have a nice, comfortable bed. Make your back is very, is very worth investing in.\nTris: And then bites he was saying. don’t struggle with a slow, bad computer. Don’t struggle with a bad screen that has bad reflections or isn’t the right resolution for you.\nyou are touching this thing all day, every day. Make it nice and ergonomic and make it fast for programming because that’s what he was focusing on. we programmers, we make a little change in the editor and then look at the website or recompile the program and see what we’ve done.\nthat loop of compiling or refreshing the browser and then making another tweak. And then based on that feedback, doing it over and over and over again. If you can shave one second off that, and it happens every 10 seconds, you’ve saved enormous amounts of time over the course of the day just in very small increments.\nSo yeah, fast, fast bites.\nRobin: limit this point of programmers, like I think with my parents\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: The furthest thing from programmers. You can imagine. I dunno if you mind me sharing this, Trish, but you said your mom just did her first poor request.\nTris: Oh my God, my mom,\nRobin: is so far\nTris: 76. Age 76. Mom did her first pr. I am so proud. She got it all wrong, but she’s learning. Oh, what a what a what A woman.\nRobin: Yeah. That is so cool. but anyway, I’ve had this big argument with them about how important it’s for them to, to optimize their internet connection. They have a really bad internet connection and they have options, but they’re just not focusing on it. And I think that they find daily life and the management of daily life really difficult.\nAnd if they just improve their internet connection, the amount of difference that would make to how easily they could manage daily life would be immense. Even with them, I mean, obviously they don’t use the internet as the extent that I do, but just\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: able to WhatsApp the family, you know, they’re not doing it properly because it feels sluggish and so they put it off\nthe\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: of having latency In your communication tech are just huge on everybody. I mean?\nTris: If it affects everything, like just a slight delay in the web browser, a slight delay in reading messages, it’s the, the same point,all those seconds add up to years of waiting. And I think, I’m not sure I’ve, I’ve forgotten if this is mentioned in the article or not, for me personally, worse than the waiting is the temptation to switch to a different tab.\nWhile I’m waiting.\nRobin: yeah,\nTris: So if something takes 10 seconds to load, I’ll tab over to something else and I could be there for half an hour, you know, scrolling, getting distracted, whatever.\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: so that was bites. And the last one is brain Scott recommends, investing in your brain, your education, your sleep, buying and reading books, getting a mentor, stuff like that.\nI’ll link the article in the show notes for everyone.\nRobin: I think it’s absolutely true. it could be doing the research on the topic we’re gonna talk about.\nRobin’s desk plans\nTris: Right. Absolutely. So I’ve described this, horrific, working space. You’ve got, what are your dreams for this?\nRobin: it has to go away out of the way.\nI mean I could send you a picture of this, but I have a little space behind my main door that comes into the living room.\nthat little alcove there, that’s behind the door and it creates this little, dead space behind it that’s about three feet wide. and then as deep as the door I suppose,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: you could just slide a desk back into there if it fitted and that would be outta the way.\nTris: Gotcha.\nI can often work quite well. Mm-hmm.\nLaptop &amp; screens\nRobin: So, so I want that. I like to have my laptop a little bit raised, so it’s in line with my eye.\n’cause up to now I’ve always worked with my laptop screen and then a monitor next to it, as you can see in my photo.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: option would be. Two monitors close my laptop. Right.\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: which would be better because then I could have monitors of the same size I don’t think I need three per se. I kinda have three when I go into work, and I don’t think it makes me any more efficient.\nI think I just sort of lose stuff slightly out of my view on the other side,\nTris: Yeah, I think that actually I, I used to have like as many monitors as possible, and then I switched to an [00:10:00] ultra wide monitor, which is twice as wide as a regular monitor. It’s like two, four by three monitors glue together. And that was cool for a bit. But I think actually that what works extremely well for me is a 4K monitor as large and as cheap as I can find.\nand that is what I’m working at, working with now. And I occasionally throw in a small secondary monitor to put video calls on or notes or something. But a 4K monitor is so big that I tile all my windows out. That that’s, I suppose that’s where we are. We’re different. I’ve got a really good,\nRobin: where we’re different. Yes.\nTris: uh, okay, cool.\nRight?\nRobin: actually what it is, is if I closed the laptop, I’d have to get a webcam, right? my laptop is where the camera is at the top of it. And that’s really crucial because what it means is my biggest screen that’s off to the right of my laptop where I put my note taking programming, having Jira open those sorts of things so that\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: laptop much of the day is Zoom, right?\nAnd that way when I look\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: to, I’m looking at the camera.\nTris: that’s good. Yeah, I like that. I always make sure my monitors are in a configuration where whatever video chat I’m looking at, it’s so close to where my camera system is. That’s nice.\nRobin: that setup, so I’d probably keep that setup. I probably just have a monitor to the right and my laptop, on a stand like I do at the moment so that I can use it for video as my video call screen. You know, I do a lot of video\nTris: Yeah, I think so. There, you’re limited in, in flexibility by having this Mac, because I, one of the reasons that Apple don’t let MAC screens fold back far enough is to make them more annoying on the desk so that you buy more screens. You know, they’re a hardware company. Everything that they do is, is designed with encouraging you to buy more, more hardware conspiracy, maybe,\nRobin: for, that’s an natural decision they made.\nTris: No other laptop in the world does this. This must be\nRobin: no other laptop in the\nTris: designed.\nRobin: fold back. I disagree with that. I’m sure I’ve had other laptops that, you’d fold ’em all the way back. They break.\nTris: yeah, but none of them are at that, 120 degree. Like, it’s so suspicious to me.\nRobin: Okay. Yeah. This is maybe something I don’t know because I haven’t like, like I suppose if you, if you actually study the angles, then you’re like,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: that Apple have chosen is different from what everyone else is doing. I didn’t know that, but that sounds,\nTris: Yeah. I admit I have no sources for this other than it’s deeply, deeply weird. And Apple are extremely good at aligning their business model to making, to encouraging you to buy more hardware.\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: Of course, there.\nRobin: agree with\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: I just feel like, we shouldn’t make a conspiratorial, accusation without evidence, but I, do agree\nTris: You’re right, you’re right.\nRobin: the company that would do it.\nTris: Yes. there’s no physical reason. it’s a choice.\nRobin: Yeah. Yeah.\nTris: Hmm. So the reason I, the reason I was sad about that, is that nearly every other laptop in the world, that the screen can fold back much further. you can tilt that laptop up in a much more vertical position and the screen can actually be way, way, way, way higher.\nRobin: got a lot more, you’ve also got a lot more desk space because your stand\nTris: Yes. Yes,\nRobin: Yeah.\nI’d love a framework laptop\nRobin: if I have to work and I need a Mac, then obviously I’m limited to what Mac will do. But, love to get a frame. If I wa if it wasn’t for, for work, I would love to get like a framework, laptop and then that could probably, you know, do what you’re saying and, and go more vertical.\nTris: Oh, my framework is arriving tomorrow. I got a framework 12, soon as they announced it, I was like, oh, okay, great. This is a nice, inexpensive way for me to get into the framework, ecosystem. I broke my laptop a little bit when I went to Rust Week in the Netherlands. I just like threw it loosely in my bag and I guess I was like smashing my back around, so I slightly cracked the screen.\nand I was like, oh, that’s not gonna get better over time. and it was about time for me to upgrade, I do like the framework like Max are fine. we’re all working inside of web browsers and text editors anyway, so it’s, most of our time is pretty similar.\nRobin: totally.\nI’m very fortunate to have a pretty modern and powerful max, so I’m very happy with it in general.\nTris: Right? Yes. that’s the bites thing.\nRaging against Apple\nTris: Yes. Exactly. I’m on record at Raging Against Apple. I think the video I made two years ago was the unreasonable effectiveness of Linux workstations and that on that video, I received so many comments. I. I had to declare bankruptcy on reply to all of them. Up until that video, two years into my, my video career, I had answered and replied to every single comment on every single video.\nThis video broke me because the reaction was so strong.\nRobin: one, people had opinions.\nTris: They, yeah. It was 50 50. Half the people were like, oh my God, finally, yes. This, this, why is everyone so, so possessed by Apple’s fixation of having everything being metal? And, you know, the, the various things that I said\nRobin: But Apple\nTris: in the, in the video and\nRobin: of advocates like\nTris: oh yes.\nThe other half of people, were very [00:15:00] upset with me. and while they might be, well, they might be. I was, I was in insulting their religion.\nRobin: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Are I, I was having a fun conversation, a little, little sidebar that we might remove. I was having a fun\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: with somebody where I decided that my religion is actually panpsychism, which I love to talk about at some point\nTris: Is what?\nRobin: is panpsychism.\nTris: Panpsychism.\nRobin: don’t worry. we’ll talk about it. It’s a completely different it’s a whole departure.\nAn entire\nTris: All right.\nGet everything up off the desk\nTris: All right. I’m gonna look that up and we’ll talk about it later. so Brain Bank Buns and Bites, chair table, that sort of thing. So I’ve got some like fundamental suggestions for you, for whatever you do with a folding desk or whatever The first one is, make sure everything is up off the desk.\nthat’s just a really good rule of thumb. Like monitors, put them up on a stand, clamp them up in a, monitor stand that clamps to the table, an arm that goes up, and then it clamps into the visa stands at the, at the back of the monitor. That way you can get them at the exact height you want and you free all of the space under them.\nThey cost 19 quid. It’s a no.\nRobin: Yeah, I’m covered on that.\nLaptop vs screen position\nTris: and secondly, I would’ve said that large screen, should be in the center and the small screen that you use for video should be off to the side.\nRobin: Yeah, that would be a good idea. Like I think that basically, I feel like the monitor. It’s the more effective place for me to work. And I find myself working on the laptop screen and I feel like I should be working on the monitor. And that’s probably\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: the reason you describe that. I’m, I should just put it to the left and put the monitor in the middle, and then I would naturally be everything on the monitor, which is the better place to do it anyway.\nTris: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.\nWhere to put laptop for video calls?\nRobin: I suppose it then means that the reason it’s in the middle is because I’m thinking for video calls I want to be square on.\nTris: Well, I’m not square on, on video calls. I have my monitor in the center and my camera and small monitor. I put the video on off to the side, and I think it’s quite natural because you, as long as you are looking, when you’re speaking to the person, as long as you are looking at them where their monitor is and where their their faces is, and where the camera is, when you are speaking to them, you are allowed to look off to the side and typey, typey type E do some work or whatever.\nBecause it’s like having the person sitting next to you, you know, you, you look forward and work, and then when you talk to them, you look over your shoulder.\nRobin: is a tricky one because I feel a bit like, you know, when I talk to you, I feel looked past for much of the time, by your, by by your setup, which\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: could say is perfectly legitimate. I don’t know how much I look at people actually when I’m on video call, and yet I still want to give them the impression that I’m there centering them and engaged with them, if you see what I mean.\nTris: Yes, I consider this a feature. over the last five years, I’ve optimized my setup a lot, especially in the last three years of doing, mentoring as part of my no boilerplate YouTube channel. I really, really care about the ergonomics of video and making it as natural and pleasant as possible.\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: And I think if you have, let’s say you’ve got a laptop screen and you’ve got a webcam above it, I not knowing when the person is looking at me or looking at something else is, is no good. Like I would actually prefer\nRobin: Like, you know, if I am looking at my monitor, you’re going to see that. I’m looking at my monitor for sure. But it’s just like with the setup I have, I feel like it’s more like 50 50 where if I put it on the left, it might be like 80 20. Do you know what I mean?\nTris: one. Why would that have changed?\nRobin: Because, when I’m not actively looking at anything on my screen, because what I’m doing is, In my head and talking like I’m thinking about what I’m saying and I naturally just look straight ahead.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: I think that’s my thought. this is why I’ve put the laptop in the middle.\nTris: Right, right. Well, you should certainly shouldn’t optimize for, for video calls in that way. Right. you don’t have,\nRobin: to optimize your video calls. I think the video calls are a massive part of my life\nTris: I.\nRobin: what I’m kind of doing in my way. Which is different from yours.\nTris: Right. Okay. So maybe the solution is a, a webcam that can then go on the main monitor\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: not staring at the small monitor all the time.\nRobin: maybe, maybe. Anyway, options. Yeah, lots of options in there.\nStanding desks are cheap\nTris: Yes. So I, your foldable desk idea, I have a bit of a spanner in the works, which is that I, I think standing desks are now so cheap. I’ve recently bought one for [00:20:00] my parents’ house. It was a hundred pounds, like a motorized static desk\nRobin: that actually,\nTris: and\nRobin: cheap. Yeah.\nTris: wildly cheap. flex his spot was the brand not sponsored.\nthey’re so cheap, like. Yeah, that’s right. Other brands. That’s what, that’s what we say on the B, b, C, other brands are available. I do love that. let me make a note of that. That is what I should do in my video is, I should say other brands are available.\nThat would be very nice. my point is that they are, they’re super flexible in terms of like getting the height perfect. Like your monitors are so close, are so close down because your, you can’t change the height of either your chair or your, your, your desk and changing your, like if you’ve got a nice office chair that had like a pneumatic raise, lower mechanism, you could get that a little bit better.\nBut being able to control both of them, you can get it perfect every single time.\nRobin: I was looking into desks, I I was looking at this and I, and I also was thinking that these motorized sounding desks are cheap enough that I don’t see why I wouldn’t get one. so I suppose that then leads me to think, ’cause all the ones I’ve, I’ve experienced are quite large. But I guess that’s\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: mostly experienced them. at work, at work we have motorized selling desks. Um, but\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: and so I was, just trying to look at how small they could be because I, like I said, I don’t need it to fold away. So if I just got a small one because the space on it was so well optimized by the vertical laptop and all the other stuff you’re talking about, although that\nTris: Perfect.\nRobin: work with my Mac though, does it? But anyway, I still feel like I probably tuck it away quite well if I had well optimized space on there. I don’t need it to be big at all. And then it can just wheel away into behind the door, you know?\nTris: Yeah, absolutely. Like the uk the the smallest ones are, are just tiny. where, how big is this? less than two meters across and 80 centimeters deep. Like you can get them really, really.\nRobin: less than two meters. two meters would not go anywhere near but fit behind my door. We’re talking about one\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: maybe less than one meter. I’m not quite sure.\nTris: Yeah. here we go. So, desktop size.\nRobin: if I got a 90 centimeter wise desk\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: then that probably\nTris: Oh, sure. You, you could definitely do that. I mean, they’ve got all kinds of, they’ve got all kinds of options. Like, you just choose the one you want. You can even do, which is what I did. You can bring, you can buy the frame, which is just the, the legs and the, and the mechanism, and bring your own desktop.\nSo you buy, and the frames go down really small, like well below the 90 centimeter minimum. You might be able to buy it outta the box and you just go onto eBay or some, like find a place that sells. Would at a specific size. I got mine on eBay five years ago. and they’ll just cut it to your exact size and then you just screw it into the, the top and you’re off to the races.\nTris’ fake mahogany (remove?)- Buy desk top separately from frame\nRobin: You mean. it is the reason for that, because only up to a point, but you can put a significant different range of desktops on the same frame because you can go quite significantly overlapping the edges of where your frame ends.\nTris: exactly. Yeah. You’d, anything you want, like that’s the ultimate customization that perhaps you should go for.\nRobin: that’s a good point.\nTris: And it’s, it’s so good. And yes,\nRobin: width of the space behind my door, for example.\nTris: and you can choose the exact color that matches the, the decoration that you’ve got, you know, light wood, darkwood or, or what have you.\nRobin: Well, the coloring in\nTris: Which is, which is nice.\nRobin: I mean,\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: Anyway.\n“Standing desks have been a miracle for me”\nTris: It’s a bit, it’s a bit Airbnb. I agree. I find stand, stand desk have been a miracle for me. They’ve basically stopped, they basically stopped me getting the lower back injuries that I, that my whole career has been plagued with. The, the big risk, uh, that programmers get is. When you sit all day and then you go home and you very often sit all evening playing video games or whatever you are sitting the whole time.\nAnd it was, I just kept getting lower back injuries. The, the primary solution is I should have been doing exercise, you know, I should have had a sport, I should have been going to the gym or what have you. But I solved it. I put a little patch over that problem by getting a standing desk and standing for most of the day.\nAnd that sidestepped that particular problem. Uh, I should make it clear to our listeners, you should definitely choose exercise and not this, but maybe both,\nRobin: I\nTris: you know, have a nice mix.\nRobin: working at a computer all day, regardless of whether you, you have other coping mechanisms, right? Like that is still something that’s gonna, that’s gonna impact on your frame, your body.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: and so, you know, you want, you want it to be ergonomic. I think I am, mean, I want to sit at my computer more than I have successfully been doing up to now.\nSo I’m, it’s like I’m kind of on a journey of trying to professionalize myself in actually staying put and, working on a significant thing my\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: So that’s part of what this, what this is gonna help enable. But I don’t think I’m anywhere close to the amount that I imagine you were sitting stationary, because I’m quite a.\nTris: Restless.\nRobin: Yes. Yeah,\nTris: Hmm. [00:25:00] You are, and I, one of, and I think you might find that in a standing desk situation, if you do end up standing with Bluetooth headphones, you know, cordless. You can just, like in meetings that are happening, you can kind of pace the room really easily and still be at the same eye level as your, as your monitor.\nSo it’s easy to go forward, back, forward back. This is what I do when I’m, when I’m drafting, get doing the final drafts of my videos, is that I’m reading the script out loud into an empty room and then like pacing as I’m doing it, trying to redraft, make, make the sentences sound better, pop better, flow better.\nlike walking is great for thinking.\nRobin: Yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah,\nRobin’s chair and carpet\nTris: Yeah. So the chair I see you’ve written, you’ve written something in our notes about the chair.\nRobin: Well, it just has to, it has to work on carpet. I mean, I think most desk chairs are kind of assuming a hard floor. And I\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: Like, I like to be able to adjust to shift my chair a bit left to right to be able to pull it in really easily. Like, I like it to be on wheels.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: but I, but I needed to be able to do that on carpet.\nBut I Googled that a little bit and it’s not that hard. ’cause I think they basically, you just buy the ones that have the slightly bigger wheels and then it’s kind of fine. And that’s what I read when I was looking into it.\nTris: Right. Um, probably, yeah. But, um, there’s, there might be an even more flexible option that you can buy, thing you can buy carpet protectors, which is like a square of plastic, like hard plastic, hard clear plastic that you just put down right under where you would be sitting\nRobin: I’ve,\nTris: and it stops.\nRobin: before and I think\nTris: No,\nRobin: I could experiment with it, but I think I’d rather just have a chair that just rolls over carpet, right? Like, I,\nTris: sure.\nRobin: it to be super rolly anyway, right? Because want to\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: I want it to be able to, I want it to have just the right amount of resistance.\nAnd I think. If you’ve got good wheels, that probably carpet might provide exactly the right amount resistance I’m looking for, because it means that it’s not gonna just randomly shift, but it will move quite easily when I, when I actually push it.\nRobin’s chair\nTris: Yeah, sounds perfect. There, there’s a, there’s a mechanism you should make sure you don’t have, which is a safety feature. I don’t know if it was a, if it’s a legal thing, like a regulatory thing, but some chairs only will roll with weight on them. So you have to sit on them and then move them and like unlocks the wheels.\nAnd when you stand up, it block, it locks the wheels.\nRobin: God, that sounds annoying. Yeah.\nTris: It, oh my God. Uh, when I worked at, when I worked at the government digital service, all of the chairs had this, and the ratcheting mechanism made it really loud to move them around and you couldn’t push them. You know, like if you wanted to push a chair outta the way it was locked, you had to sit in it and move it with your feet and then stand up.\nMy God, make sure you do not buy one of these.\nChair ergonomics\nRobin: Okay. Definitely worth taking into account. Yeah. on the ergonomics of the chair design, I can\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: decide how important that is. Like I got a chair that I was fine with at, um, you know, in my, in my old house, which is still there. Um, and I, and it was, it wasn’t, you know, one of these things that has a really shaped, like it did have a back that curves towards your back, you know? Um,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: the thing that I really like to have, which I think is probably against what you’re supposed to have, is a loose back that can, that can rock back if I want to. And like slouch, I can slouch into.\nTris: I mean, everyone is super, super different and the, the trend or the, the hype about, oh, how great this chair is, that chair is, or whatever, and people review chairs or keyboards or mice or anything that is like ergonomic, that’s a very expensive word. Ergonomic. If anything that is ergonomic, you’ve, you kind of can’t trust initial reviews because the rule that my physiotherapist taught me a few years ago is the best position is your next position.\nTris: I’ve heard this online as well repeated. So like, changing position is actually what is good for you. So if you find you buy a new chair and the new chair initially solves your back problems, but it’s, it’s because you changed, not necessarily because it’s such a magical, wonderful chair.\nRobin: I was at this, hippie Quaker week, a week ago. And there was a Pilates there that was led by this, this lady who seemed really, really expert in all this, physical, posture and frame and health and everything. And she was saying\nTris: Oh,\nRobin: good posture is always moving,\nTris: yes. Hmm.\nRobin: is that your body is responding to, all the different things that you need to adjust to just to keep yourself comfortable. your spine is an s is one of her favorite points.\npeople think their spine should be straight, but it just isn’t true. it’s a, s and it’s kind of like an s that moves around,\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: I mean, it feels very similar to what you’re saying.\nTris: absolutely. I mentioned before on, on the show that my RSI was made much worse by getting a DHD treatment. But because the, the meds that I was taking kind of cured my A DHD or they let, they let, they alleviated a lot of the symptoms, which meant I could focus more, but it meant that I like got distracted less.\nAnd from an ergonomic point of view, [00:30:00] it working for long periods of focus time is bad for your health. So it was good for my brain, but bad for my body. So you gotta just keep moving. That’s why the, the standing desk works very well for me. I’ve got an alarm every three hours and I go from sitting to standing every three hours.\nRobin: Wow, very rigid. Yeah.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: So we’ve spoken about screens, we’ve spoken about desk size, we’ve spoken about, you know, the fact that probably I want a motorized desk.\nchairs, it sounds like you’re saying there are lots. I can get one. it doesn’t necessarily matter. it just fits in with what works for me, and so\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: of that. Yeah, I mean, I, I think that’s really good. and I love the point about. How, it would be nice to have my laptop as a vertical as possible.\nTris: the general rule that brain back buns and bites espouses I’ve heard simplified recently as don’t be afraid on spending money on anything that separates you from the ground. So your chair separates you from the ground. Your bed separates you from the ground, and if you squint your keyboard and mouse separates you from the ground.\nRobin: that feels like a bit of a stretch\nRobin’s leftist podcasts\nTris: I’m thinking that we could solve the comment box problem by maybe having a button at the top of these pages that say, uh, click, you know, jump to discussion, and then it jumps to the bottom of the page.\nRobin: That is a\nTris: That’d be quite a,\nRobin: better solution. And I’m quite ashamed that I didn’t think of it myself.\nTris: so simple. Yeah.\nRobin: the reason I say that is because I think there’s of cases where, I’ve been faced with people trying to implement such things, they’re like, oh, can you duplicate this thing over there? so many cases I’m like, just do, is that what you’re saying?\nLike, just do a little link and send in the right place. need to like, recreate stuff all over the place. The beauty of the internet,\nTris: Cool. So we got a comment from, user scoop on our GitHub discussions page, saying Robin mentioned leftist podcasts. At some point I’d be interested in hearing any recommendations. so your chance to shine now, Robin.\nRobin: Yeah, so I was really gratified to have some interest in this because, this podcast definitely leans technical and, possibly towards software engineering. but my real obsession is much closer sociology and politics. so I care a lot about that space.\nI find it really interesting. I didn’t really know whether there’d be any interest in those sorts of, topics. So I was really glad to get this comment from somebody.\nTris: Yeah,I would say that in amongst technical audience, there is often an overlap with interest in, fully automated luxury gay space communism and that umbrella of things,\nRobin: Well, certainly in your audience. I dunno that every tech audience has that.\nTris: only the best audiences.\nRobin: Only the best\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: Yeah, no, I completely agree.\nTris: So I’d be interested as well. I don’t listen to any of these kinds of shows. and maybe I should.\nRobin: well, I think I’ve tried to persuade you before and you were just like, that’s too dry for me.\nTris: Yeah, yeah, that’s true\nRobin: Like they are dry, like some of these recommendations here are very dry, so you really have to be into it,\nTris: actually. I do listen to one, I listen to someone news,\nRobin: all right. Okay.\nTris: Katie Johnson’s, amusing show, but it’s all about America and like doesn’t have much impact on like my exact world. You know? Maybe they perhaps should be more, more targeted, more focused content I could consume that’s more relevant to me.\nRobin: Ah, right. Well, that’s a big feature of my interest, I suppose. Like first of all, I’m very interested in Americana. I think, there’s a reason for that, which is I suppose in one sense I’m a very high level thinker. I want to find global or possibly even universal patterns that describe or improve the entirety of human society, right.\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: and America has been for all of my lifetime and long before the global Hegemon Britain is very, very made in the image of America\nTris: right. And of course, the internet where, where we really live, like my body happens to be here in England, but I live on the internet, is a private American endeavor.\nRobin: exactly. that’s probably the piece. Yeah. Thanks for pointing that out. I think that is a huge part of the link is that I’m really\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: in, I’ve got that intersection between geopolitics, and technology. And technology is all American, like, at least, at least particularly when I was, you could say coming of age when I was a teen and early twenties at uni right.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: the whole technology space was just incredibly American dominated, right? It was like any other country was just an afterthought.\nTris: Yes, of course. the legacy of the internet comes straight out of literally an American defense [00:35:00] situation.\nRobin: Yeah. Even\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: Burners Lee is British, but,\nTris: true. Yeah. We got that.\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: played his piano, by the way, at Southampton University. He’s got a piano outside his office, so it was very outta tune.\nRobin: Wow. That’s quite a story. Oh,\nTris: Well, you’ve, that’s, that’s the whole story,\nRobin: Yeah. but what he was actually doing at the time with the internet was in America.\nTris: right?\nRobin: but yeah, that’s why there’s a lot of Americanness in in my list of podcasts. it does not particularly focus on politics, but I actually would love to find as rich, like, I don’t know if it’s me or if I just, like, what if I just haven’t found it or if they don’t exist.\nBecause to me, much of the people who are interested in doing heterodox challenging political, commentary and discussion are American centric, endeavors.\nTris: Right. I don’t think I know what heterodox means.\nRobin: right, so heterodox is, so you’ve got, you know, what orthodox means.\nTris: Uh, kind of, but maybe only in a religious sense.\nRobin: so, well Orthodox, I mean, obviously it’s very religious, but it really means, according to a single authority, right?\nTris: Mm gotcha.\nRobin: and therefore, by contrast, heterodox means multiple places, but also with a little bit of a sort of pejorative in there. Like, it starts with the same two letters as heretic, and I feel like there’s some, there’s\nTris: Right. Maybe like a lot of, like too many cooks maybe, you know, like if who, what, what, where’s the truth?\nRobin: not, they’re not, they’re like upstarts. They shouldn’t be,\nTris: All right.\nRobin: sort of thing. so I encountered it first in economics.\nTris: Okay.\nRobin: you have orthodox economics and you have heterodox economic theory. And heterodox economic theory is never going to be represented by the B, B, C,by the IMF, the\nTris: International Monetary fund.\nRobin: Yeah, right, exactly. The World Bank, the Bank of England,\nthey have started to take in some of what were heterodox ideas, but they do it very slowly. and the heterodox economists are very much kept out the conversation until there’s just no way to, hold it back anymore, you know?\nTris: Right.\nRobin: so that’s what hetero means. It means these theories that are forbidden sort of, if that\nTris: Cool. I mean, sounds good to me. Like heretic, you had me at heretic, honestly.\nRobin: but like I say, you can argue about the extent to which they do it successfully, but America’s always had the First Amendment and that’s very deep part of their identity, right?\nThe First Amendment being the one that protects free speech. so they’ve had as like a core part of their identity, this idea that free, that free speech has to be protected. And that leads to, there being a lot more places in America where people are creating a challenging perspective.\nLike they feel that they have license to do that. And I think Britain particularly is quite cautious on that sort of thing. So it’s hard to\nTris: Right.\nRobin: well-known British perspectives that are really challenging. I think.\nTris: Ah, okay. Mm-hmm.\nRobin: Anyway, the list, right? So,\nTris: Yes, please.\nRobin: as the, the, the commenter, as sc like commented only, Hours after having sent their first comment, they said, oh, I found, Robin’s blog post nevermind, which is a blog post that I had written, on the 4th of November, 2023, a long time ago, My Favorite Leftist Economics and Tech Podcasts. and it recommends a bunch of things, but, the podcast world moves quite fast and I definitely think it’s due an update. So I did put a little bit of an update in a reply to that comment, which is mostly what I’m just gonna say now, so, you’d have to go\nTris: Cool.\nRobin: it. at the time quite significantly centers around. The Intercept, which I would say has changed. So the Intercept, is, is his name Pierre Omidyer or something? Basically one of the, one of the eBay billionaires,\nTris: Right.\nRobin: decided that he wanted to create a media platform that had a lot of funding and therefore wasn’t, was free from, from other corporate pressure. And he, and he gave it a lot of freedom and it was called the\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: and the intercept it’s explicitly anti-imperialist is the first thing. anything that was about challenging American power, they would be doing. And\nTris: Right.\nRobin: also significantly lent into American Tech power. like, the way in which American technology would be exploiting people. they definitely had a significant thing about, about, Facebook’s, enablement of the Myanmar genocide. one of the founding, founding people who has [00:40:00] since gone rather sideways is Glenn Greenwald,\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: was central to all the Snowden coverage with The Guardian.\nSo that was before the Intercept, he did all that with The Guardian, and then he went and founded The Intercept with Jeremy Scahill. and then he of, went a little bit off the rails. He started being very involved with Fox News because at the time he was like, I want to go and give my message to the place where people really need to hear it, I’m\nTris: Uh.\nRobin: sympathetic to as a theory, but then he. absolutely allowed his himself and his message to be morphed into the platform that he was now very significantly platformed in.\nTris: Right. Yeah. They’re not gonna let you say, say things that aren’t along the, the lines that, Murdoch wants to do.\nRobin: I don’t wanna let him off the hook to that extent because, because there are definitely significant opinions he has that are very illiberal who is it that has a really good piece on that? so I’m really interested in like, journalists and journalism and like how you communicate the truth and how you argue about all that kind of stuff.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: I’m gonna have to look it up afterwards. That’s really annoying. but anyway, this guy is just fantastic and he has his own platform and he is very, solidly left wing as in like really well researched.\nAnd he did a piece on why Glen Greenwald’s argument that he is the true sort of protector of human rights while also supporting the police and, and these other weird things that he got into, is bullshit basically. Like he he isn’t That champion, it is a really, really good piece.\nIt’s very thorough, and very convincing. if anyone’s interested in the Glenn Glenn Greenwald story, which they might be like, I think it’s actually really important to do those things because I think I was one of them. Glenn Greenwald had a massive fan base I think he probably took a lot of people with him as he drifted rightwards, if you see what I mean.\nTris: Right.\nRobin: yeah, that’s really fascinating. So, the Intercept Great platform probably still is a great platform I don’t wanna say it’s not, but, um,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: Glen Gr left. And then for reasons that I am not a hundred percent sure of, and it’s a little bit amicable, but Jeremy Scahill, who used to run the Intercepted podcast and Ryan Grim, who used to run the Deconstructed podcast, who were both great, they went off and started, drop Site News, and Drop Site News and The Intercept clearly collaborated, or I think still do collaborate to a significant degree, but they’re very clearly creating a separation from The Intercept.\nAnd I think Drop Site News is now the more powerful, platform that the Intercept used to be. that’s significant change. And,\nTris: Cool.\nRobin: and then there’s, and then the things that are missing from my blog post, ’cause I’ve got, okay, in the blog post I’ve got like Macro Dose, which is actually UK based, that’s a UK based, uh. Economics podcast. I think economics and politics. There needs to be a name. Is there a word that I’m missing that like means economics and politics? Because the two things are so very, very related all of the time and everybody knows this, but there needs to be a, like a combined term\nTris: Oh yeah. I don’t know it. If there is one, it does it. I bet there is Deconstructed Is the podcast you recommended to me like a, a year or two ago, wasn’t it?\nRobin: probably. Yeah. Yeah.\nTris: Yeah. Yeah.\nRobin: were like, this is too dry. I can’t, I’m too American.\nTris: It wa Yes, it was. I gave it a go. I gave it a go.\nRobin: I mean, that’s entirely fair enough. Like I said, this is a very heavy way of listening is it’s just my sort of obsession. I’ve got my obsession, so therefore I, I can take the density of it, you know, but it is dense.\nTris: Right? Yes. This is what’s so great about, like, people like, Cody Johnson and, Adam Conover comedians who do heavily well researched, political and, and like topical, videos and shows is like, I can actually get through that. Me and my burnt out brain can actually enjoy and focus. Like, I can watch that for two hours, no problem.\nRobin: Mm. Yeah, no, I\nTris: Or listen\nRobin: with you. I think that’s really important. the other one that’s even more dense that I don’t recommend you try to listen to unless you want to,\nTris: me, me specifically,\nRobin: You specifically\nTris: yes, our audience can.\nRobin: is politics theory. Other, so I think\nTris: Mm,\nRobin: UK based. I think Alex Doherty is, British. it’s a UK based podcast, but it’s nowhere near limited to and probably doesn’t even touch on all that much, like, specifically British politics. it’s a lot more focused, I would say, if anything on like Israel Palestine. but PTO is. Really thorough, and I don’t know where they, where they get their sources from, becauseI want to have access to all the stuff that, like Richard Seymour, who’s a significant guest on the show,\nTris: hmm.\nRobin: to just know immediately about the latest developments in, in leftist theory, on current developments and just, I dunno how he does it, but it’s really fascinating.\nSo if you are, if you’re a proper geek on all this stuff, then I really recommend politics theory. Other,\nTris: Great.\nRobin: macro dose was, macro dose is really good for explaining p politic politics. no economics in it is, it is half UK based, I would say, and half more international.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: really good at, at summarizing that stuff.\nIt can be quite short. [00:45:00] it’s not comedy,\nTris: No.\nRobin: so that’s still true. And then I’ve got some, some more news, which you mentioned in the list. But the thing that I did never even put in this list, which I should have, I think I was probably even interested in it at the time, is, as you said, factually, which is Adam Conover podcast or, video\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: channel. and\nTris: Yeah. I like factually.\nRobin: factually is really great. Like factually, what I love about factually is like you say, the way that he does it is so high energy and fun like he’s trying to argue with people, and it doesn’t seem really serious.\nRight. And yet\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: most of the time, the experts he’s bringing on and the topics he’s covering are like really, really quite central and insightful and, and potentially transformational. I think\nTris: Yeah. Yeah.\nRobin: by factually in that way. ’cause he\nTris: Same.\nRobin: you know, his whole persona is as a sort of, not that serious person sort of.\n’cause he’s a comedian and he’s a, you know, but I think it is seriously good stuff.\nTris: I think it is. I’ve liked Adam kind of since he worked at College Humor and like his main show, like his breakout show was Adam Ruins everything. it really resonated with me because it’s such an artistic coded show. He’s like, oh you dunno, this exact framework of how the world works, let me give you all the information and then you are sure to understand it and, and think that everything is fine.\nAnd of course, just explaining something to somebody doesn’t make them fine with it or, or happy with it. And that was part of the show as well. Like, he’d explain everything like how diamonds for Engagement rings are a complete fabrication of the De Beers diamond company. And like at the end of the episode he’d be like, so you are not gonna get a diamond wedding ring now, are you?\nAnd the people would be like, no, we now we’re just sad about it and are going to do it. And if there was ever an autistic summary, it would be that.\nRobin: I mean, that is so true. I love the point, like, to me, in if you are like a a, a progressive political actor, this is such an important point about strategy that. You can’t go around being moralistic about everything to everybody all the time, because\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: is trapped in the system.\nYou can’t tell them to just not use it. if you try and do that, you are fucked as a movement because everybody’s gonna abandon you because they have to use the system. And if you make them feel too bad about it, they’re just gonna hate you because they have no choice but to use the system. Right.\nTris: Mm.\nRobin: I mean?\nTris: Yeah, I’ve, I’ve heard, heard that problem.\nRobin: turn your criticism away from them onto root causes. Right. allow them to give them entire license to use the system as long as they’re fighting the system at the same time. Right.\nTris: Yeah. Yeah. We all understand that we shouldn’t run our lives on the five internet companies that control all of our lives, but we are so ingrained with the, the, with society, which expects that all the way up to governmental level, that it’s not a moral failing to do that, it is just life.\nRobin: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And the,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: thing is to be on the right side of the politics as far as I’m concerned.\nTris: Yes, yes, of course. I have just subscribed to factually. Thank you for reminding me that that exists. I’ve, I’ve listened to like occasional episodes, but I should just subscribe ’cause I always enjoy them. I’ve got a question that I’ve, written in our notes here, is there a European focused, podcast show?\nI’d like something that is, like, what is happening in European politics, because I want to know more about that. I don’t actually like this, this small island with a weird king that we live on.\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: Like I’m is a bit depressing and weird, but I like the broader European,\nRobin: Yeah. Landscape.\nTris: stage. Landscape. Yeah. The broader, the broader European landscape like is so interesting.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: I’d be fascinated by that.\nRobin: would love to know of if anybody else, if anybody in our audience has any suggestions for that, I’d love to hear them.\nTris: Yeah, please.\nRobin: say the two UK ones in my recommendations, politics theory, other and macro dose give me some of that. They definitely comment on European, positions and developments in Europe. and there used to be a show called, that, I’m surprised, wasn’t in my list at this time, ’cause it probably existed at the time I wrote this blog post doesn’t anymore. That was, that was called, talking politics. that was with a couple of professors from, Cambridge maybe. they, they would, would also comment on European politics.\nand that was quite interesting. And it was from there, I got this, there was a topic I was very interested in, which I think I’m still very interested in, which was really about the way that the European Central Bank, like at some point there was this, there was this presentation I gave, I think at work, I think a canonical, just for fun, called\nTris: Cool.\nRobin: that I called the, the, well I called it Europe blows up, which [00:50:00] they might have used as a phrase in their, in their podcast. and the point of the podcast was that there is a sort of spending crisis in many, many European countries, which requires, Requires the, it would to fo to solve, it would require those countries to be able to create their own money with a sovereign bank like Britain can, but they can’t. And the European Central Bank is not going to give them the money that they need. And that’s going to lead to a huge sort of stalemate.\nThere’s gonna have to have some kind of resolution and it’ll be a hugely impactful for Europe. And it was really, really interesting and I haven’t really stayed on it since then because I don’t have that much European coverage and political coverage in my, in my, yeah, my feed, you know?\nTris: Yeah, perhaps, perhaps. if you do know, dear Listener, please go to cap state.com. Click on this episode, and there is a comment box, at the bottom of the page. You can click skip to, discussion. do tell us, or if there’s more in depth con conversation, we use GitHub discussions, on the, encapsulate repo.\nthat should be, that should be there. But while we have been talking, I’ve updated and we now have that skip two discussion, link.\nRobin: So there are a couple of things in here that are, that are tech focused, because I did, I did promise some tech, and I haven’t really talked about tech at all yet. Tech policy press is pretty good. It’s the closest you can get to a, a politics theory of tech, I think. so they, they, they, they have some pretty interesting topics. you’ve,\nTris: Cool\nRobin: each week work repeat is not at all political really, half of it’s probably tech specific and half it’s probably not. but like it’s about, you\nTris: it,\nRobin: running a team and honoring people and making sure that everyone has good morale and that kind of thing, which I like. there is, things like tech Dirt, is pretty interesting.\nTris: uh,\nRobin: yeah,\nTris: I think\nRobin: on the media was the last suggestion, but that’s very, very, like if you’re into journalism in America. And,\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: and leftism. It’s got better actually on the media has got stronger and it’s become particularly relevant because there is an attack on wing media in the US by Trump. from my view, it seems like on the media has taken up the mantle a little bit of being an ideological center for\nTris: Ideological center.\nRobin: the concept of free speech in terms of, you know, progressive journalism against the Trump administration.\nTris: Wow.\nRobin: Yeah. So I recommend that to you and then\nTris: Amazing.\nRobin: over to you.\nTris: Right. I’m afraid I don’t have, leftist, podcast recommendations, but I do have podcast recommendations that I think will work with our audience. just three. I’ll start with the podcast that Inspired de capsulate, which is Cortex, relay fm slash cortex. It’s, CGP Gray, big YouTube hero of mine.\nAnd, Mike Hurley, huge podcaster, another hero of mine. talking about their creative process there, what they’re doing in their own creative projects and so forth. If you like this show, it’s a started off with like, the initial ideas were like, oh, I’d love to do something like that. so I’m sure our listeners would love, would love that.\nSecondly, my friend Ammos from Faster Than Lime, a fellow Rust. and technical YouTuber started a podcast last year called Self-Directed Research, which is sdr podcast.com. It’s Amos and a friend James talking about what they’ve been up to, usually rust embedded web servers, stuff like that.\nIt’s extremely programming heavy, which will work fantastically for some of our audience and not at all for the others. You’ll know if you are, really, really good, A very tight, short. They sort of give presentations to each other. the slides are in each of their episodes shown. It’s a very interesting format.\nand the last one is WB 40, which is wb 40 podcast.com. it’s a, web. Tech, creative focus, discussion podcast. my friend Lisa is a co-host, and she invited me to be a guest. I’ve not yet recorded. We were supposed to record yesterday, but due to sickness, we had to postpone.\nSo you’ll eventually be able to hear me on an episode of WB 40. And, that’s my three.\nRobin: Wow.\nTris: yes, the rest of what I listen to is perhaps I’ll put some fiction recommendations in the show notes, but I won’t go into it in this segment.\nRobin: that sounds like a good idea. you’ve recommended those podcasts all to me previously, and I think I haven’t, properly engaged with them and I need to do that.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: Cortex is great. W four is great. Like Amos’s, self-directed research is a trip because you get to see how deep the rabbit hole goes and it makes you one really pleased that somebody is going this into detail. And two, that it’s not you, that someone else is doing all of this\nRobin: Yeah. Absolutely.\nDemo to Robin how Tris makes his videos\nTris: so. I’m going to demo to you, Robin, how I make a video in obsidian. Would you give an overview for our listeners of what you are [00:55:00] seeing?\nI am seeing a title at the top ofyour document that says Obsidian for Students.\non the right And on the left of that, you’ve got the outline of the headings in that document,You’ve got it. my process for writing a video is to not start with slides and so forth, but to start here,\nI’ve just got a marked down document with some headings and some text headings and text headings and texts. I’m scrolling all the way through it. Occasional mermaid diagram, lover mermaid diagram. Love a mermaid diagram ca.\nRobin: really meaning to get really good at Mermaid. I don’t really use them and I absolutely love the idea and so many things support Mermaid and I really feel like I should just, do the basic learning to just be able to write one on the fly really easily,\nTris: absolutely. the killer feature of Mermaid, is, it stops you wasting timeMermaid, for our listeners who don’t know, is a simple text format that you can make asky diagrams, with boxes and lines flow charts or Gantt charts or a few other options like common diagrams that you just write in text and then mermaid will convert that into an image.\nwhat you can’t do is choose where everything is. if you’ve got a flow chart that has, a box and then you point the arrow to the second box, you can choose whether or not they’re flowing from top to bottom or left to right, but you can’t do anything else. You can’t click and drag stuff, like if you’re\ntraditional drag and drop tools, you’re drawing boxes, drawing lines, that sort of thing. If you’re really lucky, the arrows might snap to the boxes and shapes that, you’re working with. They might help you a little there and then when you move things around that might keep them joined.\nBut there’s so much fussing. There’s so\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: much moving at one pixel to the left, one pixel to the right. Are they lined up?\nRobin: Well, I\nTris: I was wasting so much time.\nRobin: for, corporate use. for your job. Mermaid is definitely not gonna be acceptable for all use cases. you say, if you’re very lucky, they’ll snap. I think nowadays we’re actually in a world where there are loads and loads of these tools that have realized that you are likely to want a box and then an arrow to another box.\nand so they base their whole interface around that concept. But you’re absolutely right that you are designing the layout of the thing to an extent that you don’t do with mermaid. Like draw io, lucid\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: charts.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: Miro, which I think maybe is, is Miro, that\nTris: Miro. Yeah.\nRobin: I’ve been told it many times and I just can’t learn it. I just dunno how to pronounce it.\nTris: I think it’s, because to me it sounds very like Milo, which you,\nOh yeah.\nRobin: aware of, probably because it’s a chocolate drink mostly in Southeast Asia or something.\nTris: I’m not aware of it. Cool.\nRobin: but yeah. to me it’s almost Milo, which is probably why I call it myro.\nTris: Tasty. Right? So those tools are great and you are right, you’d want them, if you are presenting to a client especially, you might want the perfect layout, pixel, perfect colors, the branding. But I don’t, in my notes, even in my videos, I actually, the value I get out of a mermaid diagram is that it renders everywhere, including on GitHub and on my digital garden.\nwebsite, namal.com renders there. And it’s not fussy or other, it is fuss resistant. I can’t be precious about exactly moving things around because there’s just no option. this box connects to that box and it will render in a reasonable way. And you can’t change where those boxes are in relation to each other.\nit’ll flow with a simple algorithm if you don’t like it. Tough luck. Get back to work, stop yak shaving. That’s what I like about it.\nSo I’ve got a load of mermaid diagrams here in my, slides in this obsedian for students, script.\nthe tool, in question is called present term, this is a rust powered tool that is just. The features keep coming. it’s got image support in a terminal. It’s got mermaid support in terminal.\nIt’s got types and latex and different font sizes like you see here where\nRobin: isn’t an\nTris: like,\nRobin: plugin per se.\nTris: it is not, it is a markdown based presentation tool\nRobin: I, I really\nTris: presenter.\nRobin: would be presenting your slides. I thought you were using like the slides plugin or something, and you’d be presenting them through the, something like that.\nTris: Up until five videos ago, I used the slides extended plugin, which is a fork of advanced slides, which is an improvement on the built-in slides feature of obsidian.\nRobin: Right.\nTris: Really, really good. But I needed both more features and less features.\nRobin: sure.\nTris: the built-in obsidian slides And slides extended, which improves it gives you a bit more, tweaking options and some quality of life features is based on, reveal js. So it’s an HT ML JavaScript, system, and it allows you to just write in some nice simple markdown in obsidian with some horizontal rules to delineate different, slides.\nAnd that’s what I did. If you go to github.com/eight man slash no boilerplate in the scripts directory, you will see all of my previous slides. They’re all like that.[01:00:00]\nBut this plugin, this tool, present term is slightly better for a few subtle reasons. I would say that most people should probably just use the built in slides, but people who talk about programming and might want to show, code on.\nTheir presentations might consider present term because it’s got some really good features, like it can execute your code or syntax, check your code so that if you make mistakes, your presentation breaks. And that was extremely important for me as a rust programming educator, because in my early videos, I made mistakes all the time, copy and paste mistakes like typos.\nLike if you’re just showing a blob of text that happens to be code, it’s very easy for that to be wrong and you’ll never know.\nRobin: Yeah. it happens\nTris: I wrote,\nRobin: Like I remember. So,\nTris: yes.\nRobin: so many times you’ll see slides and they will have code mistakes in them and the problem is that like often that is the only reference you have for how to solve the specific problem they were talking about in the slide. So then you try and copy it, it doesn’t work, and now you don’t know why it doesn’t work.\n’cause it’s not like a full of documentation. Yeah.\nTris: Right. Yes, exactly. Um, that’s another nice thing about having marked down as your, as your slides format, is that this document we’re looking at here, Atidum for students, will eventually published onto my Digital Garden website, namal.com, in exactly the same format. And that’s another thing that present term works very nicely with,\nAnd this is actually better than the built-in obsidian slides because built-in obsidian slides uses horizontal rules.\nTo chain, to, to delineate their, their different slides.\nRobin: Right.\nTris: And when I push this code up to namal.com, you see those horizontal rules in the page.\nRobin: Yeah,\nTris: we’ve got HTML comments for control flow, and they don’t show on the site. They are there on the site.\nRobin: in multiple different ways.\nTris: Yes, yes. it’s, extremely, extremely nice. we’ve got image support, it’s marvelous.\nthis is how I love to do my slides, text is the most important thing in all of my projects. the flow, the story that is vital,\nRobin: Yeah. very\nTris: the.\nRobin: and the reason I need to learn mermaid is because I feel like I can see other people at work like being power more powerful, because I’ll write like a very authoritative argument about a thing, but it’s several paragraphs and the number of people I get to read those paragraphs is diminishing. And\nTris: Right.\nRobin: can make a diagram, in a sense that’s a more powerful, so I need to learn to diagram better. I’m very text first in exactly the way you are.\nTris: Nice. Yep.\nRobin: you do the same thing. You take a text first approach and you turn it into a presentation rather than just a document that is a bit dense, right?\nTris: Right, exactly. That’s the secret I think with my, my videos is that they are podcasts that have a slideshow.\nRobin: Yeah. Yes.\nTris: at the top of this document, I’ve got four dates in the YAML front matter scheduled, written, published, and due. scheduled when I start working on the project written when it, it needs to have been written by, published when it’s published to patrons and due when it’s actually live on the public site or, on YouTube.\nAnd this is the same across all of my podcast video projects.\nRobin: this one. Yeah.\nTris: Yeah. Yes, exactly.\nand there we are.\nThat’s, um,\nRobin: Wow.\nTris: that’s the setup. Do you have any follow up questions\nRobin: And if anyone has further questions, obviously please comment on this episode. On to capsulate.com.\nabsolutely. It is a very useful thing for everyone to know. I think I kind of knew that this was roughly your process. I think it is very interesting to know that you are using that command line. Um, the fact that it’s command line does endear me to it a little bit more.\nI don’t love that so many things are obsidian plugins. When obsidian is a proprietary, closed source platform, it’s not closed source in the sense that it encourages you to create, plain text documents, which is fantastic. But nonetheless, if obsidian goes away or you need to platform into a different markdown, editor, take your\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: right? it’s very\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: have things that are outside of that.\nTris: Yes. I’m trying to de platform a lot of my core plugins. and that was another big advantage of presenter. Like if I go to my daily note here, we’ve got my calendar on the side. but if I bring it in from off screen, I have mimicked that in a terminal dashboard.\nRobin: Mm.\nTris: Um. Which only requires markdown, not obsidian. This is the, the,\nRobin: That is\nTris: is the supreme. Well, thank you. This is the supreme [01:05:00] advantage of having all of your life plain text is that You can easily build a bit more tooling or use,\nRobin: Yeah,\nTris: uh, complimentary tools.\nRobin: think absolutely this should be a a video topic of yours,\nThis is really interesting. I know that it’s like a shot at obsidian in a sense, but it’s\nTris: Well, it’s obsidian is the best tool for doing all of this, but it is proprietary and can go away tomorrow.\nRobin: And,\nnone of us love the, I feel like I’m, I know who is a fan of obsidian, they’re really like that because they are quite interested in open source and every one of them is frustrated that obsidian is not open source.\nAnd then there’s just something they accept because it’s good enough, but\nTris: Yeah, the what’s nice is that the plugins are mostly open source. Nearly every plugin has a GitHub page. Of course, it needs the framework of obsidian to, to make sense and to actually render, but a lot of the logic could be fairly easily ported. But it, it’s not perfect. a lot of people ask me, why am I using obsidian?\n’cause it’s closed source and shouldn’t I use something else? I would love to. There is nothing else.\nRobin: Yeah,\nTris: the complexity that I need to run my life and my systems. Like, people say, well, couldn’t you use org mode or Loge or Joplin or, and like those, you know, you can mention 20 or so others, they’re all garbage.\nThey’re all simple note-taking tools, and I have transcended their ability to handle the complexity of my life. Like I, I need way more than that. and it’s not even that other proprietary apps can satisfy me. Like Todoist is a fine to do system, but that is not the level of complexity that I need to run my life.\nRobin: it works very well for you. I mean, but, but\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: this is an example of that point I was making about progressive movements. Like, I’m not telling you don’t use obsidian, but I think it is\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: for you to explain the ways you’ve discovered that you can. Inoculate yourself in places against the centralization of obsidian, right? Because that\nTris: Right.\nRobin: that’s then the political movement.I would describe it as of,\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: building resiliency and extracting from this centralized system which we, which we nonetheless have to work with. and similarly I think it’s, it’s, you know, in the open source world, I think it’s very, very unhelpful for people to try and tell everybody they should be using like the gimp instead of Photoshop.\nLike,\nTris: Mm.\nRobin: crazy argument. It’s sucks compared to Photoshop. Like,\nTris: It is so bad.\nRobin: I mean, I’m\nTris: I use,\nRobin: offend\nTris: I,\nRobin: our audience, but like,\nTris: I I, I use it every day. it’s my primary image editor, and it sucks compared to Photoshop.\nRobin: right. so don’t go around and tell people they should use the gimp. Go around and figure out why it is. The gimp is so much worse. And take that seriously and don’t just deny it and pretend that it’s not true, and\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: figure out how you can improve things. Right?\nTris: Yes, it is possible to beat Adobe at their own game. Look at Inkscape, the vector editor. There are many, it is so on par with Illustrator that there are some artists who straight up prefer it even though they have an Illustrator license.\nRobin: Yeah, totally.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/5/","title":"Desk Ergonomics, Non-Fiction Podcast Recommendations and Obsidian Deep-dive"},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/6/":{"body":"\n\nTris &amp; Robin talk about what it means to be an online creator in an age of Techno-Feudalism, and what to do about it.\n\n📖 CHAPTERS\n\n00:00 Tris’s New Mentoring Tiers\n17:01 De-Platforming and Diversifying Income\n33:19 Deplatforming and Diversification\n34:22 The Power Dynamics of Platforms\n49:53 Techno-Feudalism Explained\n58:50 The Future of Tech and Society\n\nThe Matrix\n\n\n🔗 LINKS\nOurs\n\nhttps://robinwinslow.uk\nhttps://noboilerplate.org\nhttps://lostterminal.com\nhttps://modemprometheus.com\nhttps://phosphenecatalogue.com\n\nExternal\n\n\nTechno-Feudalism Book\n\n\n🧑 CREDITS\nDecapsulate is a NAMTAO Production (namtao.com)\nIt is hosted by:\n\nTristram Oaten (https://mastodon.social/@0atman)\nRobin Winslow (https://union.place/@nottrobin)\n\nThis work is BrainMade (https://brainmade.org)\nTranscript\nTris: [00:00:00] We are about a month after I’ve launched the scholarship and diversity tears on my patron.\nRobin: I, yeah, we introduced the scholarship and diversity topic very briefly, I think in the last episode. It’s quite interesting. I think it’s, talk about the particulars of what you chose\nTris: for the last couple of years.\nWhat has allowed me to move from having a day job as a programmer to a internet creator, job, whatever it’s called, writer is what I tell my mom. But I don’t think that’s descriptive enough.\nRobin: An internet\nTris: writer. Do you write the internet? Yes, I write the internet. Well, I did before, and I suppose I still do now.\nUm, but I’m using English this time rather than, uh, code. What allowed me to bridge that gap? Money was coming in from YouTube ads, which is wonderful, and lots of people joined my Patreon, which I’m incredibly grateful for. And the money was life changing, but not enough to pay all of my rent, so I had to keep the day job.\nWhat did allow me to bridge that gap and get away from the day job was. Setting up a mentoring tier where a few people had asked me if I would do lessons if I do one-on-one tuition, that sort of thing. And I eventually said yes, because as a freelancer you should always say yes when people offer you to pay your money.\nAnd it worked out really well. I got 10 or 15 people signed up and that was enough for me to cover my bills. I don’t quite make as much as when I was working a day job, nine to five, uh, programming. But it’s more than compensated for like how nice the work. It’s, yeah. I’m my own, my own boss. You know,\nRobin: that was a question I had in my mind actually was whether at this point you are.\nMaking as much money as you were making or not, but yes, no, I completely agree. That like, quality of life\nTris: Oh my God. Yeah.\nRobin: Very much improved. Yeah. It’s the\nTris: backward spending supply curve of labor whereby when you offer people more hours, they take them, but after your boss increases your salary to a certain point, you actually choose fewer hours.\n’cause your basic needs are being met. And actually you’d rather buy your life back through doing less work, but more well paid work.\nRobin: Have we talked about this before? You, you wouldn’t, you wouldn’t necessarily. Sorry. If you’ll allow me a, a tiny segue, because I found this quite interesting. Um, there’s a podcast called The Happiness Lab, which I don’t know whether I fully subscribe to, but sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I, I put it on because I think it helps sort of set my, my mood for the day.\nAw.\nUm, and the latest episode I was listening to is about this economist who I’ve forgotten the name of, but I can put in the notes who won a Nobel Prize, uh, a while ago, maybe in the eighties or nineties or something. ’cause of all the work he’d done critiquing the, the standard model of economics. Um, and one of the big ways is this thing that he called, I think he calls it the winner’s paradox or something.\nAnd the way he characterizes it is the, is this example where you go into a bar and you say, I’ve got this jar of coins. Um, whoever bids the most for this jar of coins can have them. And if there’s, you know, any number, any significant number of people in that bar, the top bid for that jar will definitely be worth more than the actual number of coins at the jar.\nUm, and so they will have, they will have lost out, um,\nTris: right.\nRobin: And I feel a little bit like this is relevant in this thing about the job because you always want to be paid more and therefore you always want to work harder. And you, and sort of human nature doesn’t really lead us to necessarily realizing that that’s not really worth it.\nFrom a personal perspective, if you see what I mean?\nTris: Yes, uh, absolutely.\nRobin: Because we feel like a winner.\nTris: Yes, of course. I feel a little, like, I must mention at this point that like my circumstances of where I live, the UK means that I can afford to do this a bit more. If I was in a country that didn’t have universal healthcare or safe streets or like stuff like that, I might want to hedge way more and earn as much as possible to hedge against future problems, future calamities.\nBut I live in London. It’s for all the small problems. Um, it is lovely, safe. Like I won’t go bankrupt if I need a, an operation or ambulance to the hospital, something like\nRobin: that. Yeah, no, that’s a, that’s a good point. Yeah. You do need, obviously the support, the social support structure around matters a lot.\nAnd um, I think probably a lot of our audience is American.\nTris: I would say so.\nRobin: And, uh, the social support structure in America. Obviously, if your job is the only way that you get good healthcare, you might want to think about that. Yeah. That’s a good point.\nTris: I don’t like thinking about it. So moving on. The last two years have been tremendously worthwhile from like a business point of view, and I’ve been able to buy back my time to make more creative works as well as supporting myself through mentoring.\nI estimate that maybe in about five years time, maybe the, the other projects, YouTube and podcasts and so forth, would’ve increased their revenue to support my bills and so forth. [00:05:00] But this has been a nice shortcut to, to get there. That’s certainly my goal. My goal is not to rely on mentoring the whole time, though I’m very pleased to be doing it, which leads me to over the last two years, I’ve wanted to open my mentoring up to people, like students who are less able to pay for it.\nThe mentoring is quite expensive. You know, one-to-one personal tuition is, is a very premium thing and I’ve always felt a bit weird about it, but you know, my bank has opinions about how much money I should earn and I have to follow what they would like me to do. That is now done. So last month I opened up these two new tiers, mentoring and diversity.\nInitially you and I Robin talked off air about how about, I was initially just calling it scholarship, but also including diversity as well. By that I mean my audience tends to be white men because the tech industry is overwhelmingly leaning, um, in that direction. And I would like to do some affirmative action there too, to correct that in some small way.\nI was inspired by Maker’s Academy, which are a. Software retraining company here in London, and they do a 12 week conversion course. And like any degree, or any, or not even a degree, after 12 weeks, they can get you into like an entry level web development position. And they have a 10% discount for women and non-binary people because they, and they, their wording is very good in their blog posts.\nThey talk about being able to, like, they’re in a position where they can like very s in a small way Correct. The, the bias in the industry in a small way. And I thought, well, if I can do that, I’ll give it a go. It’s, yeah, so small to be almost trivial, but it’s not\nRobin: nothing. You may have mentioned it, but I, if you did, I’d forgotten that Maker’s Academy was your inspiration, but it’s very useful.\nIt’s very interesting to know That’s the, that’s where it came from. Yeah.\nTris: Yeah. Brilliant. My, yeah. Very nice. Talk to our anyone in, in the UK who’s listening that if, if you want to learn programming. They’re the way, they were the way forward before the pandemic. I was aware of them because I interviewed, I was a senior lead engineer at companies, and whenever we were interviewing for positions, it was really obvious when someone had come from Maker’s Academy because they were excellent, not just technically because they, like, they’d retrained.\nThey were like, oh, here is a, a junior JavaScript developer. Well, that’s fine. Here’s a junior JavaScript developer with a law degree. Now you have my attention. Like they, it was amazing.\nRobin: I feel there’s also a thing, a thing about that is that people, people also who retrain into something else. Yes. I feel like they have a level of intention about it that is, that is not there.\nYes. From someone who just comes in as a junior and you know, the age of like 20 or whatever. Because, because when you are 20 or so, you just kind of fall, you follow your feet and, and you fall into the path you fall into. But when you are older, it’s the same with post grads. Yes. In, in courses because they, they come in like, like now if I were to go and study at university, I’d be so much more committed to it than I ever was when I was at uni in my twenties.\nOh my God.\nTris: Yeah. Like, yeah, right. Exactly. I, I went to Plymouth University to do computer systems and networks for my degree and I went to Plymouth because they were the only ones that would have me. ’cause I failed all my exams and like, I didn’t intend to do any of it. I was just like, Hey, what’s available?\nWhat can I do that isn’t like. Stacking shelves at Tesco. I didn’t think I would be very well suited for that. And then my next degree, I’ve got a master’s in software engineering from Southampton. That was a little bit more intentional, uh, that that’s where I stopped in formal education. And as you say, if I’d gone on, you know, to do like post grad stuff, PhDs or whatever, your intentionality must increase as your brain matures and you actually know what you want to do.\nRobin: I meant specifically the job because I think even, you know, you do bachelor’s, you do masters, you do PhD, that’s still following a path. Yeah. I mean, particularly post grad students, they’ve deliberately left a path they were on at a, an age where they actually understand how the world works to then come and say, I now want to go and do this new thing.\nAnd I think that the amount of intentionality needs to do that is significant. And probably the read the people who are trained through Maker’s Academy, that’s their journey, right? Absolutely. So they, so they care about the thing to a level that like, yes. I wouldn’t have when I was like 24 working as a, as a junior developer.\nTris: Yeah. We got into software. I expect, I can speak for you, Robin, because it’s fun. A, someone who is retraining is getting into software because it’s important for the way they want to live their life and they think it’s profitable and they’ve seen the job market, like they’ve got a way more holistic view than like computers fun.\nYes, please. Yeah.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.\nTris: Oh, and by the way, the end, the end of the maker’s story is that during the first lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, [00:10:00] my wife and I were working next to each other, desks next to each other in the same room, and she was accountant, she was as a chartered accountant and I was a web developer in a fairly.\nModern relaxed team doing agile scrum, that sort of thing, and Python. And after like six months, she was like, okay, you guys are having way too much fun. How do I retrain to become a software engineer? I wanna be a web developer. And she went to Makers Academy, my recommendation, and she had a great time there too.\nSo I’ve seen it from both sides through Ducey eyes.\nRobin: And I suspect she’s a much highly developer than you are. Highly as, as we were talking about.\nTris: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Like, like she reads documentation. Yeah. Yeah. Much, much, much better. Right. So the reason I’m brought up Maker’s Academy is because that made me think I should do a diversity initiative of some sort as well as a, uh, financial hardship scholarship sort of thing.\nBut originally I blurred them together, which made quite a lot of people including you. I think when we spoke about it a little uneasy because it blended social. Disadvantage with financial disadvantage.\nRobin: That’s a very good description of my objections when we, when we first spoke about it. Yeah.\nTris: Yeah. So the solution, and thank you Robin, for trusting me about that.\nAnd thank and, and thank you to all the people who gave me feedback on that single scholarship tier. Splitting them up into two was the right thing to do. And I now have two cohorts of steeply discounted, one fifth, the price mentoring. And it’s wonderful ’cause I can, I can help the people who I would never have reached otherwise.\nLike rich white men are doing fine as a rule. Yes. So,\nRobin: so are they both, are they both the same discount then these two different tiers? ’cause I haven’t actually looked.\nTris: They are, they are in, in a perfect world there would be some more granularity, wouldn’t there? But Patreon is quite a blunt instrument and so I’ve just put them at the same price just with some, some guidance.\nAnd I found a lot of people ask me. Like, they email me before signing up. Almost no one signs up. They email and ask for permission.\nRobin: Oh, right, okay. You\nTris: know, they say, oh, I’m a, I’m a woman in tech. Do I qualify? Or, I’m a student, but I’m not actually at university. I’m doing, you know, some other complex thing.\nDo I qualify? And my answer to everyone is, yes, God. What? Of course. Come on. Yes, please. Like ev, everyone’s so cautious, uh, about it. Like I’ve, in the back of my mind, my first reaction was, oh, what if people take advantage of it? And then immediately when I thought, thought that through. I realized it would never happen because it’s not like you’re buying a product and pretending to be a student to get a discount.\nThat happens all the time. What you’re doing with the men, what people are doing with mentoring is signing up for a professional relationship, like an ongoing relationship where we will talk about their studies or talk about the challenges of being neurodiverse in our industry or, or whatever. Yeah. The idea of lying would mean that you shouldn’t have the mentoring.\nRobin: I do think that’s a very, that’s a very good point. Yeah. Although this kind of goes back to this more, I listening to this morning as well, because, um, people will generally do antisocial stuff much less than core sort of game theory. Economics would suggest that they would, people don’t just try and game the system just because it’s it, because, because if you added up on paper, it’s profitable.\nRight. In general, right? Like one, one of the clearest things was if people find a wallet and it has some money in it, you would think that the more money there is in the wallet, the less likely they’d be able they’d be to return the wallet full of money, but mm-hmm. It turns out the more money that’s in the wallet, the more likely they are to return the wallet full of money.\nTris: Oh, that’s lovely. Yeah. It’s nice, isn’t it? That makes sense.\nYeah. God, it, it would be like, it’s, it’s empathy, right? Like if I lost 500 pounds in my wallet, that would ruin that. That could have huge repercussions. And so if you find 500 pounds at a wallet, it’s like, oh, you would think, oh gosh, this person really needs help.\nExactly.\nYeah. They can’t lose this. Yeah. Or maybe there’s other complex thoughts, but yeah. Oh, that’s lovely. Yeah, it’s very nice. These two new mentoring tiers going really well,\nRobin: and I’m delighted. Trs. I’m curious how many people have actually signed up for this since you launched it?\nTris: Well, each tier. The diversity mentoring and scholarship mentoring has, uh, is capped at 10 people, so 20 in total, and I think 17 have signed up nine and eight across each.\nSo it’s very close to May. Nearly\nfully booked.\nYeah. Incredible. Oh, so clearly it’s very popular.\nIt, it is. And I, I couldn’t be, couldn’t be happier. So one of the reasons, apart from it being a nice thing to do and maybe the right thing to [00:15:00] do and so forth with the new tears, is that it also, uh, reduces my exposure to, to a single person unsubscribing, causing me financial hardship.\nRobin: You mean mentoring in general? Does\nTris: like if, I mean the new, the new, the new tiers. ’cause they’re much less. They’re, they’re, they’re $50 a month, which is much less than the normal mentoring tier, but there are way more of them. So it sort of spreads the risk. Um, it’s, I, oh, I see. There’s probably a name, probably a name for this in Oh, right.\nIn investing, you know, like it diversifying my investments, I suppose. But it takes up more of your time. Is that like Yes, certainly, certainly mean it’s a\nRobin: significant discount. Presumably the previous tiers, the previous pricing structure, um, was, was such because you, you only have so many hours the rest of your hours you’re trying to put into editing podcast.\nSo, so does that mean you are, are you suggesting that inherently you’re therefore shifting that time from editing time and therefore time that’s supporting YouTube or podcasts\nTris: into mentoring time? Lower rate.\nYes. I, I, I suppose so. Yeah. It’s, um,\nit’s a, like I’ve become more of a teacher with this, with this decision.\nMm-hmm. That’s true. That’s a good point.\nAnd diversifying is the reason diversifying my income is the reason I waited until Patreon was paying most, most of my bills before I quit my day job. I didn’t do what many people do, which is rely on adverts or paid promotions through YouTube because that is risky.\nYep.\nAnd I think that’s what we should talk about that for a bit. Yes.\nRobin: Yeah,\nTris: absolutely. In the, in the table contents, we’re calling this the cautious creator, and I think that describes me. I don’t think of myself as a very cautious person, but I’m married to someone who has, uh, is a qualified accountant. So I am, uh, I have excellent advice.\nRobin: Yeah, I have been given excellent advice. You mean we have actually discussed this quite a lot off air and that’s why we chose this as a topic for this episode, and in it you have a way of thinking about de platforming, which is a term I really like the sound of, which I think is quite an interesting model for how you effectively protect yourself from being too much at the mercy of the whims of very large monopolies who have no real interest in looking after your livelihood.\nTris: I talked about diversifying before, but like it’s got a specific name, as you say, to platforming in, in the creator community. I am sure that you, as well as Alisons will have seen a creator of some sort, YouTuber, someone on TikTok. Anyone in the public eye say something like, link in my bio, subscribe to my substack, get on my mailing list, come to this site and sign up for memberships.\nLike a whole litany of different options. And the reason that that is so pervasive is because the platform, it shows that the platform, they are on YouTube or TikTok, what have you, our inherently risky for them and they know it and they would really like as many of their audience as possible to come over to this second place.\nThe, the place for me is Patreon, but it can also be a mailing list of Substack and like whatever, come over to that place. Get more personal content, more reliable content, and critically, critically for them as the creator gives them a more direct access and direct control of their audience because the platforms deliberately do not give you this control.\nRobin: Yes, they also have an interest in making you put your link to de platform somebody like making the task of putting that in front of one of your listeners as hard as possible, which is why you often have, is it Discord or something? One of these platforms. It’s particularly scary when you click on a link and it’s like, this link’s gonna take you off this platform.\nAre you sure you wanna do that? Like,\nTris: yes, yes. That’s Discord. I think Rick Astley has a lot to take the blame for there.\nRobin: That’s very generous of you. [00:20:00]\nTris: I think Twitter does it worse. You know, they actually censor links to competing platforms like you can’t paste a MAs on. Absolutely. Yeah. No. On Twitter,\nRobin: any, any of these tech tactics, you can see it being brazenly done with a complete mask off over on X.\nYes.\nTris: Listeners of a certain delicate age will remember when you could just paste links and have them floating over YouTube videos at any point in the video and any, like, just a little post-it, a little link whenever you want a little caption and people made, like games. Choose your own adventures skill high, like, uh, ranking lists, like all kinds of stuff or like whatever.\nUh, but when YouTube switched from flash to HTML five video. They did not bring that fi functionality over instead giving us the pinned video at the top right and the end screen. Those are much, much, much more limited. Uh, the pinned stuff is really miserable for me because as an educator I talk about more than six things.\nAnd in a video length of my, of my, like about 10 minutes, you can link to six things and they have to be kind of evenly spaced and you can only link to a thing once. Like it, it’s, it’s miserable and it’s, uh, extremely suspicious as you say. It’s obvious what they are doing. So people do this, uh, de platforming to gain a bit of control back, and it’s an essential part of being a creator.\nYou can’t start with a, an mailing list. You know, like my, my dad could, could start mailing list and then tell three friends and he would have three people on the mailing list. I, I, anyone could upload a YouTube video and it could go viral. Anyone could make their first TikTok video and it could go viral.\nThat’s the promise of the platforms.\nRobin: Good example for that, I suppose could be my, my website, because I’ve had this blog for a long time. I’ve never done any advertising on it whatsoever. I’ve never paid for any promotion on it. Um, I have at various times tried to, you know, share articles that I’ve written on various platforms like Hacker News, Twitter, whatever, but only a little bit.\nUm, and then about a year ago, or maybe a year and a half ago, I decided to add the ability to subscribe to a MailChimp, um, mailing list to the blog. Um, and the growth in that. Like it took a long time for that thing to get like 20 subscribers. And then now it’s got, uh, hundreds, certainly hundreds, maybe like 800\nTris: or something.\nRobin: I’m not sure. But I don’t know if they’re real. They could all just be fake. But, but I haven’t really been publishing any content at all. It’s, it’s a very interesting, um, dynamic. You’ve\nTris: been busy this de platforming, moving from platforms that have an algorithm that can generate you a viral hit, moving to people off that, onto a different platform, like an mailing list or patron or something like that where you can target them directly or maybe even charge them money.\nI see that as audience making platforms on one side and then a continuum down to the other side, which is money making platforms.\nRobin: Yeah. And what you mean by that is that, um, an audience making platform is one where the main value that they deliver is kind of in audience. It’s kind of in that you can grow your audience and therefore you are not going to be paid a huge amount because.\nThe value proposition is largely taken up by this audience, um, growth potential. Yes. And then as you move into platforms where you get paid better, the audience growth potential drops because the value proposition more or less stays the same. And, and so if one increases the other has to drop. That’s what you basically mean.\nTris: Two examples, perhaps we’ll make it clear. Um, on one side you’ve got TikTok before they paid any ads, so like early days of TikTok, when there was no creator fund, uh, no, no products, no TikTok shop, none of this stuff. Um, and all it was was, oh, cool. Look at this haha funny platform. I’m like, you can go viral that you don’t get, you don’t get any direct money from that, but you get an audience and an audience can be converted to money.\nSo it was valuable from the start. The other side of that is a mailing list where people have to sign up and they get emails from you on. The topics that you write about it is extremely personal to sign up to a mailing list because you get access to, or you give access to your most personal, uh, inbox.\nYou are, you, you are meeting the, the customer right where they are, which is checking their mail. They’re in a [00:25:00] mode to read through things and you can ask them for money.\nRobin: Yes. Right. So the point is that it’s that the algorithm effectively between you and your users, this is almost a spectrum of algorithm.\nIt’s like there’s an algorithm between you and your, you and your, and your audience. And in YouTube you don’t get to directly say only the people who I’m gonna talk directly to the people who subscribe to me. You have all these subscribers in theory, but YouTube actually takes all that away from you.\nBecause they don’t really show people, only the people they subscribe to at all. They show them what they wanna show them.\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: Whereas in, in the case of email, you get a direct line to the people you know have subscribed to you. So that’s the spectrum that you mean.\nTris: Yes. Yeah. Maybe it’s like a direct link or relevancy perhaps.\nYou know, like having a lot of audience is all very well, a lot of views is all very well.\nRobin: Yeah. Well that’s, to me, that’s the difference. You know, in theory, if YouTube was not Liars, right, as in the way they’ve designed their platform, then that would simply be the difference between subscribers and views.\nBecause subscribers are people who actually have chosen to subscribe to your channel and will now see your videos. Because if YouTube was a, I would say the implication be behind someone subscribing to a YouTube channel is something like that. They will necessarily get a notification when you publish a new video, for example.\nIf\nthat’s not really true, what do you mean by subscriber? And I would say YouTube has really blurred the line of what exactly they mean by subscriber. Um, very, yes. This time next\nTris: year, no subscribers, right?\nRobin: Yeah. But, but, um, but if, if they were actually genuine about it, then a subscriber would be just as good as a mailing list subscriber, because you\nTris: possibly it would certainly be better.\nRobin: Well, well, but the thing you’re talking about is, is literally just that, you know, you can deliver that message directly to that person, right?\nTris: Yeah. So I, I think the medium matters too. Like having email is quite a personal thing. You are reading it, it goes directly to the person. Even further down from email might be, uh, I dunno, A WhatsApp mailing list sounds awful.\nSign up for SMS notifications sounds awful, but like that would be even more personal, wouldn’t it? That would, that would actually notify you. Um, maybe telegram groups do this.\nRobin: Yeah, no, that’s true. So notifications, the power of the notification you get to send to someone matters a lot. And to me, email is not that nowhere near, like, I rarely check my email.\nIf I get something from a mailing list I’ve subscribed to, I’m pretty unlikely to actually read it. Like the, the only emails I care about are ones that are something new on YouTube, isn’t it? Like, don’t they say like, hit the bell? Isn’t that like a thing that means I now want notifications every time this person publishes a new YouTube video.\nYes. Awful. I feel a bit like meaningless. Those, is it meaningless.\nTris: Yes. And imagine if you subscribe, imagine if you hit notifications for every single channel. You’ll subscribe to a hundred notifications every day, all the time. You’d switch ’em off immediately, like it’s, it’s self-limiting.\nRobin: You would so, so you, so you wouldn’t do that?\nNo, but no, but what I mean is, to me, that’s the real subscribing, because what does subscribing mean? If it’s not, I want to get a notification. What I’m saying is, I think if I actually did that on a video, like let’s say someone news, I actually want to know when they publish a new video. So I’ve installed the YouTube, the YouTube app, and now I say, give me notifications.\nEvery time someone news publish a video, and now it gives me notifications. That’s actually something I’m much more likely to pay attention to than an email I get from a, from, from a mail mailing list subscription. Fair\nenough.\nTris: Not everyone thinks like that. Some people prefer notifications. Some people prefer emails.\nLike you, you’ve gotta spread out your, uh, you’ve gotta platform onto multiple, multiple things. You’ve gotta give people the option. Where are you? Where do you wanna get this? Yeah. Where do you want to get updates By email or mastodon by notification. But I\nRobin: suppose, I think that that means that the notifications point particularly is a little more complicated for me because I don’t think a mailing list, I don’t think a more, what I would call a more empowered, uh, as in you having more control over the relationship between you and the user, the listener, the, the audience.\nYeah. At least in the form of an email mailing list necessarily gives you more ability. Well, I mean, it does, I guess it does because YouTuber designing how encouraged you are to subscribe to any given video. Um, but, but, but the trouble with that, the thing is that, is that you fundamentally got the phone operating system sitting between, um, your, your connection to the user.\nLike it controls all notifications. So maybe part [00:30:00] of the reason why I feel like if I subscribed, if I asked for notifications on a particular YouTube video, I’d actually be more likely to pay attention down that to a mailing list. Might be something to do with the way that Google have designed Android and Google have designed Gmail, to be honest.\nTris: Yes, perhaps. Uh, and also everyone manages their email differently. Some people can somehow manage an inbox zero, you know, pristine, perfect, uh, situation. I’m very fortunate. I,\nRobin: I don’t know. I feel like no, I, I, I reject that a little bit or I wanna push back on it. All right. I think that, um, my experience of email just never being a reliable way to get a useful notification is very common.\nAt least, I’m not gonna say universal, but very, very common. And, um. As I say, I think it actually is quite an important point that the, the Android or Apple have a lot of control over the stickiness of any given notification that you might get. And the, and the app\nTris: notifications tend to be much more, uh, they have much more power.\nI am astonished to hear you say this\nreally,\nbecause you are admitting that you are letting Google control your notifications, uh, when you could invest some time into figuring out, getting email working better, and then you would be free of their influence in this regard. Okay.\nRobin: Why does that surprise\nTris: you?\nLike you understand where the control points are?\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: In the digital attention economy, and I’m okay,\nRobin: but this is like, this is like the point we were talking about last time. Like we’re all, we’re all trapped in the system.\nTris: Uh, maybe. I don’t have notifications on my phone.\nRobin: Okay. Just turn ’em off. But like, you could, but then you have to make sure that you’ve designed a whole load of other places, ways to get the things you actually need to know about Indeed.\nLike you can do that. But you are definitely, I mean, I I am not like you speaking as if you, as if you are the 50th percentile when you’re about the 99th percentile in that regard.\nTris: No, no. I, I’m speaking directly to you, Robin. I I understand that most people use their phones in the way, the Google market.\nOkay.\nRobin: Right. But what I’m saying is, what I’m saying is, what I’m saying is I’m not, I’m, I’m not you. There are places in which I am probably a massive outlier.\nTris: Mm.\nRobin: But. In most ways, I’m gonna be closer to the average as you are. Right. There’s gonna be most ways in which, in which I’m closer to average, and you are closer to average.\nYeah. Trying to do what you are describing is a huge amount of effort, and you’d have to like really, really focus on designing, taking control of that particular part of your life. Me having the values I have has nothing to do with whether I’ve successfully managed to claw back any bit of power from the system, is what I, what I’m suggesting.\nFair enough. I mean, I, as I think is true with you, I think there’s, you know, there be thousands of ways in which you don’t, um, you don’t live your values, right? Because you just haven’t focused on making that Right. I’m\nTris: a YouTuber who doesn’t like YouTube. Like we, we all live in paradoxes for sure. Right?\nRobin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Um, back to the, uh, de platforming discussion. Yes. What we prepared or what you prepared as a, as a, I, sorry, I can’t say we, I didn’t do any of this. Um, you prepared this graph where you put, um, some. Platforms on this, uh, graph where one axis is like, are you getting audience or money, like it’s audience to money, as in is the value that they give you paid in audience or is it paid in money?\nAnd then the other axis was power, which, which I’m responsible for putting there, I think. And the reason is that I think this is a different, I think this is a different dimension. I think this is a very interesting, uh, discussion we had that led us to hear\nTris: Yes, the, the listener is going to hear the final thesis based on like three hours of brainstorming.\nBy, by you and I. You, and by the way, you started by saying we, oh no, actually you No, no. We made this quadrant. I made left. Right. You made up down. Go on. Please. Credit where? Credit to do go on our, that’s very kind.\nRobin: Yes. No. So to me, what’s inherent in de platforming is the idea that you are trying to take your livelihood and wrench it from.\nPlatforms into being under your own control now.\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: this is definitely something of a spectrum because if you wrench your audience off YouTube and you, you put them somewhere else, you are probably still reliant on platforms to some extent.\nTris: But yes,\nRobin: as in, uh, you gave me the example of you put a link that’s like, subscribe to my substack in the description of the YouTube [00:35:00] video direct people there when they’re listening to your, to your YouTube video.\nThe better thing about Substack Substack is another platform. Substack still has control through being another platform that you are accessing your audience through. But the better thing about Substack is that hopefully at the time of recording, I don’t know this ’cause I don’t really know Substack, but you say it’s true.\nUm, you. Actually get the email addresses of the people who subscribe to your substack at time of recording. Time of recording. Um, and that’s, and that’s quite an important point because the central thing that I’m thinking about is, is how much control have you actually got over the dynamics of where you make your money?\nSo for, so, you know, YouTube could be paying you consistently 3000 pounds a month, um, every month for five months. And there is absolutely nothing to guarantee you that they’re not gonna change some facet of the algorithm without an update, without asking your permission. And next month you’re gonna earn 500 pounds because they fundamentally control the algorithm that decides how much money you are paid and the algorithm that decides how much of, how much of the audience that YouTube control see your videos.\nAnd to me, that progression in power control over. The way in which you can connect with the audience is the really centrally important thing. Um, and there is something of a, uh, a relationship between that and the amount of money you’re given we’re sort of suggesting, but um, yeah, but it, but it does feel like a different axis.\nTris: Yeah, there’s definitely a, there is. I, I think there is a clear, intuitive, and, uh, shows up on this on our quadrant graph that the listener will be able to look at. Um, we’ll put a link in the show notes. Um, the, the, there is definitely a relationship between like platforms where you don’t have much power tend to be the ones that offer you an algorithm that can put your content in front of thousands of people.\nAnd platforms where you have total power aren’t obliged to give you anything so they don’t. But you can have more direct access to those users and can then advertise and ask for money and products and services and that sort of thing.\nRobin: Yeah, I mean, there is the point that like, you know, at least in the current world, like in an ideal world, the amount of power that I would like, like we would like for, for people to be doing social media through a fully decentralized social media service based on open web standards, and therefore there was no central authority that had any power over the way that you are distributed to your social media audience.\nUm, and you are taking payments through some open source payment software that you run on your own server, on your own website and you are like, you know, this would be the ideal, fully empowering infrastructure for you to reach an audience. That’s kind of a fantasy in today’s world. So in the best version of this, you are still gonna be sitting on top of a bunch of platforms.\nAs in your mailing list will be managed by MailChimp. Um, but, but I guess a version of that de platforming to me is therefore also the diversification that you start off talking at the beginning, talking about at the beginning. Yeah. If you are a YouTube creator, the entirety of your connection with your audience is through YouTube, and therefore it is de platforming simply to spread your audience across a few platforms.\nIt’s further de platforming to use a stack of different services in the way that you reach your audience.\nTris: Yes. It’s, it’s a very good idea to both increase, it’s both de platform to platforms. You have more power and multiple of those, like, don’t just check out my Substack also here’s my Patreon, that sort of thing.\nAbsolutely. Yeah. In many ways it’s, it’s, it’s, it seems like the old problem with musicians and labels, like the Beatles can be as good as anything but the labels. Bridge the gap to America? Yeah. Like, um, is it Apple? Their label, I, I forget what the name, the, the name of that label. Um, but like, your, your label has a huge, has resources to get your posters up, get your CDs in record stores, get your tracks being played on DJ, on, on, at the radio station by DJs.\nLike they, their offer to you is virality, sort of, um, sure. Yeah. Which, if, if you were doing it yourself, you would not, you would not be able to, you’d only be able to have linear word of mouth feels. Yeah. Which is why it was a really kind of like, that,\nRobin: it was a really big thing about, um, you know, trying to get black artists represented by, by labels.\nLike that was a, that was a massive [00:40:00]\nTris: right\nRobin: sort of battle, I guess in the, in the sixties or, or so. Um. Because they, they simply just weren’t given the access at all. Like the labels were like, um, I was reading this thing about how Billie Jean, like Michael Jackson’s, Billie Jean, was a very significant point where the, some universal records.\nI know. So some really famous record company said, we’ve learned our lesson after they, after they realized how much more popular Michael Jackson was than the white artist that they had been insisting on supporting for a very long time.\nTris: It’s\nRobin: amazing.\nTris: Yeah, no, like three orders of magnitude of data is must be very persuasive.\nRobin: Yeah, yeah. Um, no, so it is, that’s extremely funny. It is, it is the same point. But then of course the record labels have now, um, all been given a piece of the very powerful Spotify platform,\nTris: which is Yeah. Oh my God, yes. Yeah. As a, uh, as a musician.\nUm, I, Spotify. Every, every year, Spotify, give me a few pence. Uh, and I look at like the, the thousands of plays, like, well thanks. Thanks, Spotify. I’m wonderful. Wonderful. So I try to de platform my people to band camp from Spotify, but of course, Spotify doesn’t let me message my audience. That would be too easy.\nI, I think the, the, the problem that black artists had before Billie Jean that you have talked about that I don’t know much about, um, sorry, it didn’t entirely go\nRobin: away with Billie Jean. I just wanna put that in there for the, uh,\nTris: I I can, I can imagine, uh, the, it sounds like the, the same problem exists currently with LGBT creators and especially creators working in the, uh, king and sex like areas like you, you can’t say that sort of stuff on YouTube.\nUh, you can say it on OnlyFans, but OnlyFans do not have an algorithm. Like, you are not gonna discover people by like browsing some front page. Um, you, you, you would do that on TikTok, on YouTube, but you, you can’t do that. So pe so people who use these platforms for their livelihood, sex educators and others have to engage in like ancillary content creation on YouTube.\nAnd the other ones like, a good example is, um, Dr. Lindsay who does explanations on YouTube, which is a, like sex ed course. Uh, no adverts run against those videos because they would get demonetized because of the content. Um, a a different, going back to music, a different problem is the copyright problem because you can’t play music.\nSomeone like. Adam Neely, who is a professional bassist, who, who makes videos about music and music creation and so forth. He, in one of his videos, he pointed out that he can’t teach you music on YouTube because the way you teach music is you play a few minutes of Tchaikovsky or you play a few minutes of Earth, wind and fire, and you study it together and go listen to that baseline, listen to that, uh, that the, the, the way that Tchaikovsky wrote this section, and now let’s piece it apart.\nYou can’t do that. You play more than three seconds and you get a copyright strike. So you can’t teach music in the way that it has always been taught. You have to de platform onto Patreon or Substack or whatever. It’s not always about money. It’s about escaping the limitations of the platform and they’re bullshit.\nRobin: Yeah. Well, this is an important thing as I think, you know, to an extent, these platforms can keep you in there while. By saying, by, you know, saying you have to play by the rules. And if you do play the by the rules to some extent, you might, you might keep their favor and they might keep giving you, they might keep, like actually letting you earn a livelihood.\nUm, and I think that there are many, many ways in which they’re subtly doing that all the time. And I think you and I have spoken about the extent to which we as a product, as in encapsulate, as a, as a project, um, we, we, you know, we’re both very aligned in, in trying not to be led, um, by market forces. But I think that there are many, many ways in which all of those, all of those market forces try to try to, try to lead you, encourage you in ways that even if you think you’re very woke to it, um, they will try to, um, encourage you into forming your message in just the way that is palatable to the platform.\nAnd, um, like, I mean, on YouTube, uh, you, you know, the amount you swear, uh, the amount you,\nTris: yeah.\nRobin: Uh, certain, you know, you, you shouldn’t, you certainly shouldn’t be saying, um. Things like Zionist or, uh, I dunno, like no, there are certain words that you cannot get away with saying, and, and, and that’s just an example of the sort of [00:45:00] power that they have.\nTris: So we’ve talked very tactically about the, the real world problems of the platforms and the real world, the things you should do as a, as a creator, all that you have to do with de platforming and diversification, all that stuff. But let’s zoom out and I want to hear from you, Robin, because this is your wheelhouse, not mine.\nI want to hear about the, why they’re doing all this, what we need to be concerned about, um, that sort of thing.\nRobin: Yeah. Um, I wanna see this topic actually a little bit because I know that we talk presumably to a significant amount of software engineers. Um, and this is not, not these tech literate people.\nYeah, tech literate people. Well, this is certainly not an exclusive topic for software engineers, but I do think if you work in software engineering, you are. You are building the system of which I’m about to speak. And because of that, I\nTris: think it’s quite important for people to have certain vocabulary as they do it.\nYes. Names have power.\nRobin: Yes. That’s kind of one why I wanted to bring in the, uh, bring in the topic. I think we know that the world has got worse.\nTris: Um, there was a huge promise in the internet, um, in\nRobin: the nineties and two thousands that we were very excited about,\nTris: failed internet.\nRobin: It was a place where you could go and find fellow hackers, um, in almost an unlimited number of ways, and you could create stupid creations that just did really fun things.\nDrawing links between people and throw up really stupid artwork. And it was chaotic and ugly and, and great.\nTris: And\nRobin: and beautiful.\nTris: Yeah. And it felt, you can find\nyour people I think\nmaybe.\nRobin: Um, but it felt like you like that like the future was going to be the enlightenment realized where everybody was now sharing and building on each other’s ideas.\nAnd there were, there was no, there was no limit to all the social links that we could create and all that sort of thing. Ah,\nTris: epitomized by the ffs late and great John Perry Barlow, I think who I can quote from memory because he wrote the Declaration of the Independence of cyberspace, governments of the industrial world.\nYou weary giants of flesh and steel. I come from cyberspace, the new home of mind. We all thought it was gonna be like that. Yes, precisely. Yeah. So I’m not even reading that’s, that’s up here. That’s permanently in my brain.\nRobin: Yeah. So I think I’m probably not alone in being pretty disappointed about where the world has gone.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: And it’s mostly gone that way. I think because tech companies have built power\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: In a way that we, the rest of the world was not really paying enough attention to prevent.\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: And I think understanding the character of the power they’ve built is pretty useful if we want to prove the world from this point forward.\nTris: Yeah. Our walled gardens have. Got higher and higher walls.\nRobin: Yes. And the important and, and an important piece of that is that we thought the people who founded these tech companies were just like us and had good values and therefore we could give them all the power and they would do good things with it.\nTris: Yeah. Google, literally, they were supposed to do no\nRobin: evil. Surprise. Surprise. Turns out that when they’ve got the power, they support right wing movements and they just make huge layoffs and redundancies and they try to create all sorts of tech that just pushes people outta jobs and, and drives down everyone’s salaries and, and everything, which is not surprising.\nYeah.\nTris: It’s been a, a big disappointment. I dunno if some of the younger members of audience might not have lived in a time with the you that Robin and I lived through where we really wanted to be hired by Google. It would’ve been the most prestigious job in the career. I’ve had two Google interviews in my time.\nOne in 2008, 1 20, 20 10. They’re famously difficult and they didn’t get through, but like everybody wanted them and now couldn’t pay me enough.\nRobin: Yeah. So, I mean, I had a, uh, several years ago I had a recruiter reach out to me for Google and they said, this is the character of the interview. Go away and, you know, prepare and then tell me when you’re ready.\nUm, and I did for a while. I bought the big thick book of like, you know, how to prepare for Yeah. Algorithm coding to do. Yeah. And I, and I did all, did all the research and then I never actually got back to them. And my drive to do so has only gone down and down and down and down. And now I just have no interest.\nTris: Yes.\nRobin: I think I’m gonna start with trying to describe techno feudalism because I think it’s very, very helpful. [00:50:00] So Yánis Varoufákis has written this book called Techno Feudalism.\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: And it was a shift in thinking for me, because while I knew many of what we just described, the. Ways in which these platforms will use various levers to try to fit everybody into the boxes and the way of behaving that is most profitable for them, or maybe just drives their interests in a different direction.\nThis is a sort of high level theory, which, well, it’s a shift in thinking for me. What he says is that we all think we know what capitalism is. Free market capitalism is where you have the freedom to create a business. You can market your products to other people. There will be a certain level of perfect information.\nI suppose you’ll be able to show that your products in the marketplace are cheaper than the next person’s products or are better than the next person’s products. And so therefore, through pure competition, you will do better. And if you are therefore creating good products and you are working hard, you will.\nWhen your business will go up.\nTris: Not only that, but such a system due to the adherent efficiencies is good for the customer as well.\nRobin: Yeah. So I’m not gonna go in a direction that it could go in there, which is all of the holes in the standards of economic model. But the important point is that Yánis says we are no longer in capitalism.\nHe says, we have moved on from capitalism. Capitalism has destroyed itself, eaten itself. And we’ve moved from a single market where you have a bunch of different people trying to compete into what he calls techno feudalism. So feudalism is a system where you have lords of the land and they have people working the land and they.\nPay those people enough to just sort of keep them alive so they can keep working the land. And most people’s existence under a feudal system is\nTris: as wholly owned. People serving the Lord and being given enough to, to stay in that role,\nRobin: but they don’t have any rights over\nTris: the land within they, within which they live.\nAmazing. So the theory of techno feudalism is that each of these platforms is like a feudal state\nwhere specifically we’re talking about the fang platforms approximately, aren’t we\nbig\nones?\nRobin: Um, yes. Although I don’t, I think the idea is that it’s sort of, um, it, it, it works at, it works at a small level as well.\nYou’re just a smaller feudal Lord. Like, right. The real capital is in, like, in, in a feudal system. What makes the difference is that you own the land. When you have a a feudal, you, you, you know, you get, you get to be the duke of this land then. Mm-hmm. You get to control that little space. You might have a small one, you might have a huge one, but fundamentally that’s the difference between being a feudal Lord and being a, um, I have forgotten the terms, but anyway, being, you know, somebody who works on it, like what’s a serf in this?\nIn, in, in the feudal state? Yeah.\nTris: A serf. Right. They’re the people that work on the land.\nRobin: Okay. Yeah. Um, so\nTris: indentured dentured\nRobin: serf, right? I i, if I’m trying to create Robin winslow.co uk right? Or sorry, I think it’s do Robin Winslow uk. I should probably know the name of my own website. Um, it both, right? They’re one.\nRedirects to the other. One directs to the other. Sure. That is. Really a play. You know, that’s my feudal territory, I suppose. It’s just that I don’t get to live very much within it. Um, but, but the point is that when you, like, if you want to sell almost any physical product nowadays online\nTris: and you are not selling it on Amazon, you are unlikely to be able to sell it.\nSo\nRobin: you don’t have a free market. You have the choice of whether you want to go and try and sell within Jeff Bezos’s or whoever the CEO of Amazon is. But I mean, I think, is it still fair to say it’s owned by Jeff Bezos anyway? Um, if, so, let’s say Jeff Bezos, um, within Jeff Bezos’s feudal state. And the reason why it is very much Jeff Bezos’s feudal state is because.\nYou don’t get to choose where you are ranked in the, in the rankings. Most people don’t. I mean, you know, talk to, so this is where it overlaps with, with unification. I mean, if you go [00:55:00] and Right, listen, listen to in justification or, or read, read the book of unification. Oh, if anyone wants to hear the first, the introductory chapters of in justification, um, Cory Doctorow’s podcast, he just read out like much of the book, um, on, in episode 500.\nIf you search for it, I’m sure you’ll find it right. He describes very well all of the ways in which Amazon have a bunch of different case studies. Amazon’s one of them, Amazon, apple, possibly Spotify, how they all have control over their domain and they keep control over their domain. And the point is, there is no free market.\nNow, there is only greater and lesser feudal lords who control different markets within their feudal town,\nTris: right?\nRobin: So if the actual price of making your product is 70 p. Amazon take 30% commission, you have to sell it for a pound on, on Amazon. So you now have to sell it for at least a pound elsewhere. And you have to get other people, you have to convince other people to pay at least a pound, even though the thing only costs you 70 p to make, so you then can’t compete anywhere else.\nThat is worse than I thought it was. Yeah. So how awful. The amount of control these platforms have is huge and everybody knows that. And what that’s done is it’s completely reset the logic of the, of the, let’s say, global competition space if we don’t wanna use the term market so we don’t confuse people.\nMm-hmm. Because now what you are trying to do, if you set up a new business that is independent, is to try to take some of this feudal, like take your slice of this feudal space. So it’s not enough for you to be producing a product well and selling it well. You now have to have your own online delivery mechanism and you have to use all the same tricks as they use to try to solidify your power to be able to control your audience.\nIf you don’t do that, you then have no choice but to sell on Amazon, and you will then progressively have your all of your money stolen. Because Amazon will like, take too much in commission. They won’t let you sell anywhere else. And then eventually they’ll just roll your product into their Amazon basics line and you won’t, and, and then they just won’t promote you at all.\nAnd they’ll just, they’ll just sell everything directly. Awful. So, so I think this is very important to understand because I think that, um, as a professional working in the creation of online services\nTris: mm-hmm.\nRobin: You are, you are being asked to create many, many different things that I think are a piece of this sort of, um, this control puzzle.\nLike they’re, they’re, they’re trying to, so if, if you are. I see this all over the place in little design decisions that you might be making in the building of an, of an app,\nTris: right?\nRobin: Like you made the point about how they used to allow you to put links on YouTube videos, right?\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: Then they upgrade to HTML five, and when they upgrade to HTML five, they, you can no longer do that.\nThere’s a perfectly rational way to explain to everybody why you don’t do it anymore, which is because it was harder in HTML five and we couldn’t, you know, couldn. Yeah. It’s a good, good excuse, right? Exactly. Mm-hmm. We couldn’t, we couldn’t afford the engineering type or whatever. Yeah. Google couldn’t afford it.\nRight. Those sorts of prioritization decisions get made all the time, and I think as a worker in tech, you shouldn’t just be letting, like uncritically accepting that somebody’s made the decision that this is prioritized over that without being aware that it very likely fits into a larger, bigger picture business strategy, which kind of has no choice but to be a little bit.\nCompeting in this kind of feudal system, if you see what I mean.\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: So I mean, I, I, I find that really like a, like, like a very, a very transformative way of thinking about the modern economy. Obviously it’s very depressing. Um, yeah, and it’s, and it’s probably not like perfectly true, but it’s like to have the option of thinking about it in that way and be like, look at a particular mess up situation and be like, is this better described by market capitalism or is it better described by techno feudalism?\nTris: I first heard, uh, the expression techno feudalism. I’ve not read this book, um, that you mentioned that we will link in the show notes. I first heard this expression from Cory Doctorow’s blog in the, in his article, all capitalists want to be feudalist. And it explained basically what you have explained and the idea that you, you might start out with a very disruptive, free market product like Netflix, where you, uh, undercut the competition and you provide a better service for the users.\nBut then once you’ve got all the users, what you want to do is keep them. And that changes the business strategy from one of disruptive capitalism where you have to actually give the [01:00:00] users the features they want to ones of Feudalist where you prevent them leaving, or destroy or absorb competition. And so there is no competition left.\nNow, capitalism without competition, what’s that? It looks an awful lot like feudalism. And the, the way that I think Corey described it is that you, it’s, it’s so transparent because you look at. You don’t listen to what a company says their publicity is what they’re saying. What you do is you read their annual investor reports where the truth lies.\nAnd in the annual investor reports, they talk about how the, the companies who want the investors to keep investing or to, or, or to, uh, be happy, they talk about how they’ve got, they’ve absorbed this number of competition. They’ve destroyed the, uh, x competitional y competition, or they might have done nothing.\nAnd the investor portfolio, the investor booklet notes that this in comp, this competitor went out of business, isn’t that good for us? Or they’ll talk about how they’ve secured certain patents, usually through purchasing companies. Yeah, yeah. Um, purchasing patents or other. Restrictions on the freedom of the market or whatever.\nYeah. And it’s because they don’t want to be capitalists, they don’t want to compete with other people. Investors certainly don’t want their investment to have to compete. They love to be feudalist where they don’t have to compete at all. They just churn out money.\nYeah. Yeah. So this is the, I think this is the, this is the, this is upstream of Cory Doctorow’s\nRobin: very popular theory of in enshitification.\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: Because it describes why it happens basically. So the theory of enshitification is that as an online service or business, you start off by offering a great product because you want to get loads of users. So you offer great value for users, and it’s, and it’s wonderful, and everybody comes and joins you.\nAnd in a, in a lot of cases, they were giving away, you know, significant things for free. Then when you’ve got all the users, then you, you start to exploit your users to say to the businesses, oh, um, I’ve got all these users now come and come and do business with me, and then you or advertise,\nTris: right? Yeah.\nRobin: You have a, you have a great, and, and you, and you give them a great deal because you can afford to, ’cause you’ve got all these users that you can exploit. And then after a while you’ve, you’ve worked out how to entrap your businesses, and then you, you now just start exploiting your businesses to then deliver to the shareholders.\nAnd that’s, and, and, and the, and the quality of the product goes down and down and down, right? Like it goes down, you know, it’s like to start with it. The thing that really matters is, is, is the quality of the product for the users. But, um. But it also, the quality of the product for the business is significantly drops, which is why the bus, it’s important to think, you know, in techno feudalism terms, your standard businesses are also a lower class, right?\nThey’re not, you know, your, your small business owner that everybody, you know, politically, all politicians want to say they want to protect. Your small business owner is just another exploited class because they just get completely fleeced by the people with real power. And that is so, so techno feudalism is the structure for why enshitification is inevitable more or less.\nThat’s that, that’s how I think about it.\nTris: That is new information to me. That is a very, very clear way of saying it. Thank you very much for telling me that Robin, techno feudalism is upstream from enshitification. In enshitification. By the way, the, the explanation that Cory gives, and you’ll, excuse me, adding to yours is that first you give all the value to the users, then you carve out the value and give some of that to your business partners.\nAnd then finally you carve out the value from your business partners and give it all back to you, you in the middle so that neither the users nor the business partners have any value. You’ve got it all. Yeah. Yeah. Awful. Hate that for me. Like I, I Deliveroo like last year, or I dunno, they, they’re like, Hey, you’re gonna have to start paying delivery charges even though you are a premium subscriber.\nAnd I was like, really? You’re gonna have to fucking get off my bank account then. Goodbye. Like if I, if there’s multiple levels of premium. My card.\nRobin: Yeah, exactly. And, and we,\nTris: I did the same round. We’re in an\nRobin: age where you can just see this happening all over the place. Right. Like every service is just getting more and more expensive and more and more exploitative.\nUm, and, and this is why, and I think it’s useful to understand why. And it’s particularly useful to understand for the people who are helping to build it. I’m not saying I’m not judging you for building it, [01:05:00] um, at all because I work for a tech company, um, we, we only do our best.\nTris: Gotta read. Yeah. Yeah.\nRobin: No judgment.\nWe chat by the system. Absolutely.\nTris: It’s a comic, I think, or something like that. Like, hey, great news. We’ve, we’ve, we’ve built this cool new product called the Torment Nexus, inspired by the book Don’t make the torment nexus.\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: Like science fiction is like, you weren’t supposed to make the pan opticon.\nThat was a cautionary tale. Like we need a sort of a programmers union where we all agree that we’re not gonna build the killer robots like the people, the Feudalist who run the companies, they can’t build the killer robots without us. Yeah. We are the ones\nRobin: that will actually be building it.

So this is extremely exciting. Robin, tell me about your ergonomics update.\nRobin: Yeah, I finally got a desk. it’s, it was\nTris: Wow.\nRobin: of quite straightforward. So I’ve shipped out my old dining table and now I’ve got myself a,a mechanical raising and lowering desk that is 110, I think centimeters wide, which is just perfect to fit behind my door.\nTris: I’ll say right at the top here that we are not only are we not sponsored by any of the things we’re about to speak about, we don’t even have affiliate links. So, did you get a, a flexi spot desk? I think I mentioned that last time.\nRobin: mention\nTris: had good experience with them.\nRobin: it and I think to make it affordable, it relied on finding a really cheap place to buy wood, which\nTris: Hmm.\nfailed to do. And I discovered that I think basically these desks are not that complicated. So I’ve got like a fairly well reviewed thing that was actually from Amazon, for my. Shame. do put, the way I work with Amazon is I put quite a lot of effort, particularly if I’m spending any significant amount of money, I put quite a lot of effort into trying to find, to buy it from somewhere else. And then at some point I just give up and buy it from Amazon. That’s okay. I do the same. Like I, I, I switched off my Prime subscription so that my default wouldn’t be Amazon, and now I try all the local stores. I try this, I try that, then I try eBay. Then when that fails, I agree. I fall back to,\nRobin: so this\nTris: to the one supplier.\nRobin: it’s, I can’t fault it really so far, like the,it’s clearly not like solid wood because it wouldn’t have been as cheap as it was if it were, but, as in it’ll be, MDF covered in a coating, but it’s\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: enough.\nTris: I didn’t wanna spend like 300 pounds on, on super long-term furniture. MDF is, is, is very clever and in addition to being very cheap, it’s also very light. Like a solid wood is very heavy. the big drawback with MDF that, that I’ve seen on various DIY channels is that it’s like you have to have a bit of preparation before you drill through it because you are drilling through something that is not quite as predictable as your solid wood.\nYou know, there’s, there’s, there’s splintering, there’s more. I believe I’ve, I’ve heard people talk about waterproofing\n, you know, if, like, if you spill a coffee and then it goes into the hole that you’ve just made suddenly the entire, that it like compromises the,\nRobin: explodes and it\nTris: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\nRobin: Yeah. But anyway,\nTris: You find that, that there’s a half and half situation and I think the first party flexis put tabletops do this.\nLike the, the outer five centimeters are solid wood and then the, the most of the middle is MDF, so that you can like, yeah, I guess you, it means you can like drill into it, you know, screw something into it. Like I’ve got a headphone\nRobin: here and I’ve, you know, just little bits. And that’s, you tend to want to do that around the edge.\nthat makes sense. this\nTris: Yeah. Interesting.\nRobin: a headphone hook, pockets dangling off the\nTris: Great.\nRobin: it’s\nTris: The dream.\nhole for the cables to come through, although, I dunno why, what I’m gonna use it for,Nice.\nRobin: that’s like off in the back\nTris: Tidy.\nRobin: I literally put it\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: the side away from me. but it’s, it’s been perfectly fine. It goes from 72 centimeters high to 120, no, a hundred and it must be more than that, right? A hundred and I can’t remember what it goes up to. Yeah. But,it’s high setting is. high as I could need, and low setting is as low as I could need.\nIt’s, know, it’s perfect. And I’ve got my stand for my monitor. I’ve got my little stand for my laptop. it’s big enough for my usage because I, it’s not like I spread out papers all over the place. yeah. And the\nTris: Marvelous.\nRobin: is probably from what, maybe or something like that. I can’t remember.\nTris: Ah,\nI don’t believe that’s gonna be very useful for our international audience.\nRobin: it’s a very well known, chair in the sense that like this same chair was available from a bunch of different places. so it was like. It’s basically the cheapest chair that I could find that looked like it had decent wheels and a mesh back and,and a tilt feature and goes up and down, know?\nand\nTris: Marvelous.\nRobin: perfectly fine. I don’t have any complaints about it at all. yeah, I was trying to keep the price low and hit all the important points and I think it’s,yeah, it’s been great.\nTris: Wonderful. How about the, what is on the desk like how’s the, the monitor situation? Like the, the laptop was on a stand. You had the old MacBook keyboard, the, the perfect, the most perfect keyboard in the world. like what, what, what’s, what’s on the, on the desk?\nI’ve got the perfect keyboard. Great. I’m so happy for you.\nRobin: that’s the main, that’s the main feature to be honest. and that, that sort of hasn’t really changed because that bit I. I like, I already focused on, I already had the arm for the monitor. I already had the arm for the microphone. and they clip better than they did onto the old dining table that I had. so there were points where they’d just they’d be fine for a while and then one day they’d just fall off like\nTris: Oh, no.\nRobin: the dining table. but no, this is now more solid. But apart from that, the setup’s pretty much the same. I’ve got my little portable, folding stand for my laptop, which keeps my [00:05:00] laptop up and away a bit. and then, yeah, I’ve got my, got my mouse and my perfect keyboard.\nTris: Wonderful. I’m, I’m very pleased for you. The most important question is how has it affected your day-to-day work?\nI very much, I’ve only actually done a one significant stint of working, standing up. Hmm.\nRobin: But it was good. And I think I’d like to do that. I’d like to do that more. I think if I feel like I can stay at my desk longer\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: vary my way of working at it. if I change it from standing to sitting or something like that, I feel like I\nTris: When I first got, yeah, when I first got my, my standing desk, I tried out a rule that I read somewhere, which is to take meetings, standing up calls, standing up, like remind oneself that like, oh, this is, this is that, because it allows you to pace, which is you typically do when you’re talking one, you know, like on, on the phone or whatever.\nand it like is a nice reminder to sort of get up. And meetings can often be quite boring, especially in our field and like standing increases the energy slightly so you don’t fall asleep, which is quite, quite nice. Us\nRobin: yeah. I’ve struggled for a long time with trying to find a good wireless headset that includes a microphone, I think is\nTris: yes.\nRobin: Possibly, but the, the video, the video, the, the, the webcam doesn’t come with you either. So I’m, I, I come back to my desk to speak.\ncan, I can be walking. in, in a fair amount of the room and people could still see\nTris: Hmm\nyou know, obviously they know I’m pacing, but hmm.\nRobin: like that’s,\nTris: Yes, there is\nRobin: important thing is that I can speak and they can hear me,\nTris: the, yes, that is true. Although, as you know, and I think probably our listeners have got by now, I really, really love having high quality audio. Even when I’m on a call, you will not find good quality Bluetooth, headphones. It is not the microphone’s fault. It is the proto the wireless protocols fault,\nRobin: right?\nTris: that.\nRobin: I did buy myself a thing that I then promptly broke very quickly, which was like a Barracuda X maybe, gaming headset. But basically the only good,\nTris: Oh yeah.\nRobin: was that you can buy like a, what you want is a boom arm, right?\nTris: Mm-hmm.\nRobin: I’ve done this quite well that I now have this, I now have a wired, boom arm that I can plug into my, to my headset here, my wireless headset, my, Sony X, whatever they are, wireless, headset. And I can plug in this boom arm, that’s wired so I can then plug it into my laptop. And that works well for like me being out in a noisy place and it brings the microphone close to my mouth. and that’s, and that’s great. wireless versions of that, that you can’t not, I don’t think you can just add a wireless microphone to this wireless headphone. I don’t think that exists. but to get a microphone that is a headset like this and or a smaller headset and a boom arm, you’re looking at like in, in the business space, you’re looking at like Jabra, and\nTris: Ugh.\nRobin: are super expensive as well.\nThey’re not good. They don’t look good, they look not comfortable. And they’re also\nTris: No.\nRobin: 250 pounds or something crazy because I suppose they’re targeted at enterprises or something. the\nTris: Hmm\nRobin: is also quite expensive, but maybe a little bit more affordable is basically gaming headsets. And in gaming headsets,\nTris: hmm.\nRobin: get things where you can plug in a, A-A-A-U-S-B thing, a that has its own wireless standard that he uses to communicate between the,\nTris: Got it.\nRobin: Quite common. Like a 2.4 gig,wireless, connection. Yes, exactly. Yeah. That can be, then you can have, you can have like a gigabyte, a gigabit of bandwidth. You know, that. That’ll be, that’ll be plenty.\nTris: Yeah. So I might go back to buying myself another ’cause I just like what happened? I snapped the. the dongle that you plug into the side of the laptop. Ah,\nRobin: I,\nTris: whoops.\nRobin: it plugged in and I like shoved it in my bag or something, and it just bent. I don’t know.\nTris: Mm,\nRobin: that was annoying.\nBut I need to, and then once you’ve killed that, like the, you can’t use the headphones. there’s no way to fix it.\nTris: ouch. Oh, no.\nRobin: I hadn’t thought of that. That’s a good, good idea. The, my, my experience with key con Keyon keyboards is that they have a, a, a 2.4 gig wireless dongle because of course, in gaming every nanosecond accounts. but I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m a wired guy. As, as I, I think, you know, the battery life is great on wired stuff.\nTris: The, latency is great on wired stuff. The bandwidth is great. Oh, love lover. Lover went thing. However, I am wearing,Bluetooth headphones. Same as you. I wonder if the Bluetooth stack could be done, could be rooted backwards, like use the same Bluetooth profile, which is called, high quality audio, or pro audio or like whatever the, whatever the one is we’re doing now, but flip the transmitter and receiver so that the, the transmitting part is the bit that you’ve got on your head and it pushes it down over Bluetooth in high quality stereo to the, to the computer.\nRobin: Just\nTris: wonder if\nRobin: were possible, it would’ve been done because I [00:10:00] know what you\nTris: Mm,\nRobin: done this thing because I did try out some Bluetooth headphones and, in\nTris: yeah.\ncan be Bluetooth headphones Oh yeah.\nRobin: and you just notice Yeah, like switch into, microphone mode\nTris: Headset, headset mode, it’s called.\nRobin: the degrading in the quality of what you can hear is insane.\nit’s so obvious and it’s terrible.\nTris: mono.\nRobin: Yeah. And it’s, it is awful. Like it’s really bad. and it’s just astounding. I don’t understand how we’ve persisted on a standardized standard like this. There is, I don’t understand how this can be such a difficult problem to solve. It’s clearly not because other, because, other, like people with proprietary wireless solutions can do it, so why Bluetooth?\nTris: Here’s my guess, Bluetooth chips are all the same. They’re mass produced. The, the ADCs and the Dax, like, they’re all like built to one standard, and that standard assumes the normal way of using headphones. So I bet the Bluetooth, like there’s a, like a Qualcomm or some kind of Bluetooth chip in my Sony headphones that is the same as in nearly every other Bluetooth headphones.\nAnd it’s that, that, that does all the Bluetooth stuff and there’s only one version of that.\nRobin: But,\nTris: you, it’s, it’s too expensive.\nRobin: one of the default use cases for Bluetooth is surely, a Silicon Valley dick with a. a, with an Apple phone and those white,apple wireless headphones, right? And they’re having a\nTris: Yes, AirPods\nRobin: like walking down the road, you wearing these white headphones. that is a situation where you need good quality two-way audio.\nTris: It is. Yep. And I suppose Apple have got the, the fabrication to do a higher quality version, but most don’t.\nRobin: Yeah. They probably do, they probably got like their own standard stuff that is not in other phones and whatever. that’s, and that’s why you should buy like the Apple Bluetooth headphones because they like add this proprietary layer because they control both sides. and that’s, but that’s, that’s another example of why the standard shit like the standard.\nTris: that’s because the standard doesn’t do it well for everybody else, Hopefully it will do it eventually. Like it’s only in the last, is it 10 years, 15 years that we’ve got the, the Bluetooth,\nRobin: it’s only been\nTris: the,\nRobin: for a decade and a half.\nTris: like the, the Bluetooth head, the high quality profile. yeah, I, I’m seeing that the quality, of AirPods on Android is very bad. What a shame. What a shame.\nDIGITAL GARDEN\nRobin: we’ve got a second update that I am even more excited about from you, Robin.\nI’m reading here. Digital garden update. Oh my God. Tell me all about it.\nTris: it’s not that much to tell. it’s just that, like we spoke about the digital garden, you told me about digital garden, this obsidian plugin that, That allows you to easily link a folder. It allows you to easily, tag a document in your vault say, I want this to be published onto the web. so you set up this link that uses a GitHub repository and,right? is that, is it Sal? if you used Versal, that’s fine. I used GitHub pages.\nRobin: I did the, I did the default thing. Like I just,\nTris: is versa. Yeah.\nthe default tutorial. And I was curious because I’ve not used Sal before. yeah. So by default it, it tells you to set up a GitHub repository and a al, Mm-hmm.\nRobin: and it’s linked into that. And so therefore you put this like metadata that says publish. Whatever. and then you, and then another ator in my case that just says, this one’s the homepage. and then it puts that on the website for you. And that then means that you can just edit your obsidian in markdown like you normally would. And it will just go up and it’ll be represented on the web as this, as this webpage.\nTris: And I was really excited when you told me about it. it’s got this whole philosophy, as you said about digital gardening behind it, where the idea is, rather than us, like thinking very carefully about how we’re gonna design a website and then, going through a whole load of steps to make sure we’re producing exactly the design that we’ve designed and all this. you are, creating a more of an organic place where you can then can just tweak it here and there. You can tidy up, you can, do some weeding. Yeah, I first heard of of Dig Digital gardening through, Maggie Appleton’s incredible post, the Brief History Ethos of the, the Digital Garden linked in the show notes. And, I fact that the, in the intro, there’s a couple of paragraphs that I will read just in case the listener hasn’t, hasn’t, isn’t up to date.\nshe says that a garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organized by their publication date. Unlike blog, they’re inherently exploratory. Notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren’t refined or complete. Notes are published as half finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.\nThey’re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we’re used to seeing. [00:15:00] And that that idea of being less perfect, is why I thought they were gonna be pretty good for, uh, the perfectionist, who is my cohost.\nRobin: Yeah, I mean I\nTris: I.\nRobin: this is probably something, it probably fits into a thing I’ve been trying to do in my life broadly, which is that like I think I. I think I’ve never been, I’ve always been very far from perfect. I’ve always been very chaotic and I very rarely like finish things. And I’ve realized that the only way for me to be effective in the world is to really stop expecting myself to be perfect.\nAnd that is a very difficult journey. Like it’s, I’m trying to minimize the judgment on myself. and I’ve done that in many ways. Like I’ve always been a very transparent person and I’ve, I think I’ve clocked two decades ago that me\nTris: Oh yeah.\nRobin: to be radically transparent is one version of me trying to work against my inherent self-judgment by saying if I just expose everything that’s going on and I tell everybody, all the secrets and whatever, and they haven’t lynched me, then it’s fine.\nYes. Radical transparency. Winslow, that’s, that’s, that’s to tea of friends. Yeah.\nso this, as you say, fits in very much with that. I think broadly speaking,I think crafted messages is another way to describe propaganda. and I don’t love it. I prefer that people be much more organically, straightforward with what’s actually going on for them. And, this is a great way to do that with a website, which I absolutely love. And I think it would free me from a lot of the, a lot of the worry anxiety that prevents me from writing more on my own website because I, at some point in the process of sitting down for a significant period of time, writing a whole article, committing it and pushing it so that it gets published. Thinking about whether it’s messaged in the right way for the right audience, somewhere in all of that. I tend to fall off and be like, this is too much. as I wander away and I never return and then therefore, and never gets published and\nTris: It’s a bit overwhelming.\nRobin: hopefully completely shortcuts that and we don’t know yet.\nI only just put it up so you, you can now see if you want to garden robin winslow.uk, which is some point will become Robin Winslow uk, but not today.\nTris: I’m there now. Beautiful.\nRobin: and it’s not got anything there really. It’s just got a very tiny little, you’ll see it. It’s, I haven’t even thought about what’s up there really.\nWell, don’t worry about it because by the time our listeners hear this, there might be something\nthat’s true.\nTris: so I, there\nRobin: and the fact that\nTris: I,\nRobin: publicly spoken\nTris: yes,\nRobin: now, as in, we haven’t published this yet, but I have done the beginnings\nTris: we’re gonna.\nRobin: about it, is going to make me want to, focus on it a little bit more, which is a good thing. hopefully as Trish says, by the time you look at it, it not completely pointless.\nTris: Perfect.\nSchedule\nTris: Let us move on to something I’ve just thought of that we need to talk about, which is we are changing our schedule. Fortnightly was a bit, ambitious. monthly ish. I think, is gonna work better for us.\nI think if you go going back and listen to our very first episode, we actually suggested that we would do it monthly. geniuses.\nRobin: and yeah, but I think that we then fell into, we I\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: we wanted to meet every week. We wanted to alternate the planning and the recording sessions then led us into, it’s gonna be fortnightly,\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: but I think\nTris: Yep.\nRobin: if we find our way to do monthly, yeah.\nI think that will work better because what’s tended to happen is that record and then we will, I have been taking quite a long time to learn how to. do the cut like a, find the publishable cut of our ramblings, that I’m okay with. And that’s been taking me weeks, up to\nTris: I mean, you’re doing a great job.\nRobin: better at\nTris: You are,\nRobin: yeah.\nTris: yeah. Like a hundred times, a hundred times better. Like you’ve gone from zero to, to editing very quickly. And I’m rea I really appreciate that. Takes, takes some of the, the editing burden off me. And then I, for, for, for the listeners’ interest, I take that initial, cut, which Robin does in the script.\nand then I throw that into Reaper, the best audio editor on the planet, though it does look, does look like it’s from 1995. The, and then I make, I do, I like handcraft, make sure everything flows extremely well. And I, and I do death by a thousand audio cuts, so to speak, of my, of my life. Throw a load of effects, make sure it looks, make sure it sounds good.\nproduction noise, that sort of thing. I only use effects that work on raspberry pie, not because I have a raspberry pie, but because I want to hedge against the inability to do any of my professional life anywhere I wish. So like the, I’ve standardized on arm Linux as, as that, like minimum viable platform.\nLike if the, if it works on um, Linux, then damn it, it’ll work anywhere. And so a surprisingly large number of things do. But I, this sort of restriction does limit me quite a lot. Honestly. Even if I just chose [00:20:00] Linux, it would li limit me quite a lot. I once spoke with a prof. I, I, I paid for some mentoring with a professional, musician, professional mastering person, producer.\nAnd I said, and my first question to him was, what do I do? How do I, you know, I can’t use all of these commercial plugins, Adobe’s plugins, the isotope plugins, all of these things. I need to just use, like basic, basic plugins that work everywhere. What do I do? And he was very, very clear. He said, mate, you are fucked.\nAnd, and I was like, oh, no. But, but surely, no, no, no. He wanted me to spend 2000 pounds and buy a Mac Book Pro. that did not seem like a very sensible thing. But repo is the cornerstone of this. Repo fm, not sponsored is the, is where to get it by the same person who made Winamp, if anyone remembers the nineties, marvelous.\nRobin: And you can\nTris: Still going strong.\nRobin: design.\nTris: Yes, yes. They’ve not unlike Wood Amp, which has got a cool, I suppose it does have a cool skin, but yeah, it’s, it’s, uh, it’s very Windows 95, but the, it is more powerful than anything and it’s got Vim Key bindings. I’m delighted with it. Uh, VIM Key bindings using the Reaper Keys plugin.\nCome and talk to us. Come and send a message to me on the discussions for this episode if you’re interested, because there is a further explanation required on how to get that set up, but it’s extremely worth it.\nRobin: much not us. This is you. If you wanna know\nTris: Yes. No, don’t worry. Yes,\nRobin: ask\nTris: yes. Robin will read the message, but I will be replying.\nYes, absolutely. Okay. That’s the update.\nRobin: the limitations of LLMs. I have a structure and framework for discussing that I’d like to present to you and our listeners, and it comes down to the core difference between, LLMs, how lms process, language, and respond, and how humans do.\nTris: there is a marvelous philosopher called Alan Watts, my favorite philosopher. I have a few books of his here and in his lecture that is available on YouTube, on meditation, he talks about that the biggest problem in the world is that we talk about the. Symbols in the world instead of the things that are in the world.\nNow, this is a bit a bit dense and philosophical, but I promise that I’m gonna come back to linking to lms. So the idea of talking and rationalizing our lives in terms of our thoughts are that we’ve got this idea of\nwhen we, when, when you and I talk about a car, say we, there are three levels. Of this discussion. The first level are the words that we use. It’s a red car, it is a Volvo car. Like these are just words then when inside our respective brains, when we are communicating with these words, we’ve got some, what Alan Watts calls symbols, perhaps this is a philosophical term.\nand those words resolve into the symbols in our minds about these concepts. And the symbols are what our chemical brain has associated with this word, the car, and what we see as the car and what we hear when the car drive cars drive past us, and our memory of stories about cars and all of our cumulative experience through our lives about cars.\nAnd Abot says that that is much better. Than the words because the word. but, but that is not the real thing. The real thing is deeper down the car that we are talking about. Perhaps we’re both looking at a car that is parked on the street, is made of metal and plastic and rubber and all this other stuff, and atoms of those, of those components.\nAnd none of those actually have names in the universe. Like each little atom doesn’t have a little name like it does in a database. They’re just there in the world. In reality, we have given them names to talk about and our chemical brains have turned them into symbols to think and reason about. And the problem when discussing the car is that the symbols in my brain about a car have a very different uh.\nDifferent relationships in our an in my analog brain to the ones that they do in your analog brain and the purpose of education. One of the purposes of education is to like fill up out all our symbols so that we can at least talk on kind of the same terms. But as, ah, forget who, I forget who said this.\nIt might’ve been like Shannon or one of the, one of the communication giants. The biggest problem in communication is the illusion. It has been completed successfully. So I say I’m, I, we look out for that car, and I, you think I’m talking about the car that we [00:25:00] are looking at, but talking about the car that is behind you and about to hit you.\nThe biggest prob you think the communication has finished successfully. You’re like, oh, yeah, don’t worry. I’m, I’m looking out. Yeah, the car’s not moving. Brilliant.\nRobin: Why am\nBut the biggest prob, about to die in this scenario?\nTris: oh, well, I’m trying to warn you and perhaps I will dive and catch you outta the way. so I am bringing the good ship a DD back into Ritalin Bay and finally coming back to talk about LLMs. I hope it is obvious where my argument is going to go. LLMs are these networks of weighted, networks of tokens with weights between them so that you can jump between the tokens and find a likely, a likely path through the network, and you will make reasonably plausible bullshit out of it.\nIE completed sentences. the an LLM that has been taught on the English language has about 500,000 words, which is perhaps approximately 500,000 tokens. Maybe it’s half, maybe it’s double. But that’s the sort of order we’re talking about. 500,000 is a very small number of anything. My eyes and your eyes.\nIf your eyes are as good as mine can see 500,000 shades of red. They don’t have names, but I can tell the difference between them. And in my mind, in my analog chemical brain, I have symbols for those different shades of red and there’s way more than 500,000 of them. And that’s just the color red. And it’s just me thinking of a simplistic example.\nAnd not only are there other colors, I dunno if you know this, robin. There are things other than colors.\nRobin: I,\nTris: I.\nRobin: have seen, I’ve seen one or two. Yeah.\nTris: There might be trillions or multiplied by trillions of these things that of, of, of these symbols in our brains, like, more than that, maybe multiplied by another trillion plausible, like it is so far away from the 500,000 words of the English language that an English language language model has access to.\nIt is laughable that any knowledge, any cleverness could ever be possible in such a limited system.\nRobin: Yeah,\nTris: So\nRobin: sorry. Do you\nTris: yes. Yes, please, please. I’ve, I’ve, I’ve, I’ve, yeah, that is my, that is my argument discussions.\nRobin: Yeah. my brain goes in a couple of directions, although I did look up the quote and,\nTris: Oh, thank you.\nRobin: knowing where it came from is completely appropriate because,it seems that\nTris: Apocryphal is it?\nRobin: knows exactly\nTris: Oh fuck.\nRobin: hate that fully. Half of the quotes I look up for my videos are apocryphal. Ford did not say you can have it in any color as long as it’s black. Someone in the eighties in a business book said that, oh, sorry. Do carry on.\nI dunno, this is apocryphal. I dunno that it’s like something it says here, there’s no circumstances of evidence that George Bernard Shaw\nTris: Ah, yes.\nRobin: So I guess he\nTris: He,\nRobin: that\nTris: he,\nRobin: think\nTris: he said a lot of things.\nRobin: attributed to. who it isn’t necessarily true, but it says here at the top,\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: George Bernard Shaw.\nWilliam H. White, Pierre Martino, I dunno,Joseph Kaufman Anonymous. Anyway,\nTris: Yeah. Yeah.\nmatter. It’s a good quote. Great quote. what I was gonna say is I’m curious, I’m curious how much you think that the, so we know that regardless of how many symbols we might have in our brain. We are communicating, at least when we’re doing it in written form, purely through the words in a language set. Absolutely. Yeah,\nRobin: and so that is the thing, this really fundamentally the space within which the LLM is trying to work is\nTris: absolutely.\nRobin: through this language set. And so I’m then curious how much the mapping for us between those words and much, much richer and more complicated symbols in our brain has to do with the way that an LLM actually works. Do you know what I mean? so\nTris: yes. Yeah.\nRobin: and,\nTris: We all need a, a philosopher and a psychologist and a brain surgeon perhaps to answer that question. Yes.\nRobin: we do. I, as in Okay, you’ve brought\nTris: Oh,\nRobin: I love it. I was just reading\nTris: oh,\npage for Alan Watts. rude. Yeah. His life is great, by the way. What an interesting person.\nand it’s,so this is my space. I’m interested in it. So let’s, so let’s explore it. The, ’cause you could argue that it is related, in the sense that what’s happening with an LM is it’s reading all these words that have been written by Hmm. Yeah.\nRobin: humans, and also apparently auto-generated stuff by chat GBT five or whatever, which is just insane, but whatever.\nTris: Yeah. It’s not gonna get any better, is it? Yeah. Go on.\nRobin: but\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: it, let’s, in an ideal world, say by [00:30:00] humans, so it’s reading, all this stuff is written by humans and behind all that stuff is, versions of. Our work to take a much more complex space of symbols and convey the meaning of that to each other right now imperfectly. Sure. But that’s what we’re doing when we are writing and we un and we’re understanding each other, right?\nAnd so it’s then working backwards, right? And looking at that and trying to figure out what’s the complexity underneath. And so you could say that the thing that it’s then doing, whether it’s generating this probability vector graph between, between the appearance of this word next to that word and the appearance of this sentence, that sentence, or this kind of thing, which is its version of trying to understand the actual meaning of the text. it’s, those probabilities are then a model of symbols system, right? And so then,so you could argue that is what it’s trying to do, and therefore your argument is, there is no possible set of relationships between those words. That can ever meet anything close to the complexity of the set of symbols that we in fact have when we are understanding meaning from human communication.\nTris: I don’t think I, I don’t think I agree. uh, what you have said is, is is very clear and pretty good, but I don’t think what, an LLM is a model of the, in infinitely, near, infinitely more complex relationships in our mind. I think it’s a model of language\nRobin: Yes. Fair\nTris: and not, and not of like meaning or intelligence.\nLike it’s the, the, the, the, they’re not trying to be intelligent. They’re trying to just solve language and like they fully have, like we’ve, we’ve completely solved the language problem, which is amazing. I think the.\nRobin: a very technically, spelled good capitalization, hangs together. It’s got, a subject and a, and an object in whatever sentence. Perfectly fine.\nTris: Have I told you on the podcast? We’ll have to cut it out. If I already have about my, the first time that I saw a demo of the company, we farms technology specifically about their African language translation model.\nRobin: I don’t remember. I.\nTris: I went to a talk and they said that, so we, we farm is, was, was because all good things run outta money, was a social network for farmers in rural, in rural Africa that would, they could swap tips and questions and answers about like how to better increase their yield of coffee or how to solve the drought that was coming or I’ve only got this, what do I, how do I get why?\nbut you, you have a very heterogeneous language problem to solve there with lots of different national languages, African languages, lots of different nations, lots of different languages. And we farm said that they had demonstrated their, Their natural language processing. This was way before LLMs.\nThey were doing it the hard way. And the first, their first slide was, a, a paragraph of a, of a language. I didn’t, I didn’t read. And they asked if anyone knew what the language was and a few people answered. And eventually someone said Swahili. And the person said, you are wrong, but for the right reasons.\nAnd they did their whole talk. And then at the end they came back to this slide and said, this isn’t Swahili. This is, like this, this sounds like Swahili, but is gibberish. We put random data, we ran our algorithm backwards and put random data in at the end and produced like something that sounds like Swahili, but is nonsense.\nAnd it was such a good demo. I was like, wow, that’s cool. Like I, translating Swahili is like, to me that’s all very well, I, I have no way of knowing how good it is, but generating seman, syntactically valid or sonically valid things, stuff that sounds like Swahili, that suddenly, that is, that is very, very clever.\nRobin: Yeah. feel though that’s\nTris: You can generate\nRobin: what, even like Carroll was playing with the jabber walkie.\nTris: Yes, exactly. Ah, yes. Or or vo on poetry, you know, like, they sound like words, but they are not words or those, those songs by like, I think, I think they came outta the USSR where, where they were like western style songs that just were nonsense. That sounded like English to the, to the Russian ear.\nRobin: yeah,\nTris: fun.\nthe, so they, the reason I’m telling you this is they put random. Data in at one end, and what came out sounded like Swahili, but was nonsense. Do you see what I’m saying about LLMs?\nRobin: not meaning Yeah, absolutely.\nTris: It’s modeling language, not meaning.\nRobin: agree. But this is the thing. so you, I think that the [00:35:00] explanation of the symbols behind the words that we use in our\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: and how they are so unimaginably vast in number\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: very interesting as a way to think about our use of language.\nI think that’s very interesting. The thing\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: curious about is how much it’s usefully applied to even an, to as an answer to why LLMs have no intelligence. Because to\nTris: Right.\nRobin: seems like it may,and so when I said that the vector graph, the statistics, the probabilities in the vector graph that are underneath its understanding of language, Are like a model of our symbol system. What I meant was it’s the closest thing you can imagine to that within the way that LMS actually work. But basically, I agree with you. It’s a difference in kind. so fundamentally the thing that makes LMS not be able to produce any form of intelligence is that they’re not trying right.\nTris: Yeah,\nRobin: nothing about the way that the thing is written is intended to understand problems and then reason about what would be a good solution to those problems. That’s just\nTris: right.\nRobin: in the way that the thing is written at all.\nTris: Auto completes, trained on the internet is incredible and it is a solved in a whole category of problems. That category of problem is language.\nRobin: Exactly. Exactly.\nTris: you, you said just a moment ago, something I think that is very telling. Why does it seem. Like they have solved intelligence.\nRobin: Hmm.\nTris: Why is it so easy to trick people into thinking with demonstrations of chat GPT and what and what have you?\nThat it is intelligent and I have an answer for that as well. And the answer is a question. What is the largest part of the human brain? Robin, do you know the largest section at its function? What is the function of the largest part?\nRobin: perhaps.\nTris: you, it sounds like you know way more than me. I was just gonna say the bit that does language,\nRobin: Okay.\nTris: it is like the.\nThe, the la we are such language focused species. It’s the reason with why we are at the top of the food chain. Not ’cause we’re stronger or anything like that, but like language, like, which gives us technology, which gives us guns and so forth. So, you know, it’s not all good, but language is,\nRobin: To kill other\nTris: we’re s\nRobin: true.\nTris: we’re so good.\nI mean, we’re good at running long distance. I suppose we’re the best long distance runners on the planet, but we are so good at language.\nRobin: That’s cool.\nTris: We are, yeah. Oh, it’s bipedal, right? So it’s really efficient. Like we’re the only bipedal runners. So you can like, you can outrun a gazelle ’cause the gazelle gets too tired.\nYou know, they, the old postal couriers, they had to swap horses multiple times of the day ’cause the horses would get tired. We don’t, we can carry on just doing marathons quite slowly, obviously. Especially if you’re not in training, but like you can run all day or jog all day or you won’t overheat, a horse will overheat.\nRobin: Yeah, that is\nTris: anyway, that’s what, yeah. Well, yes, that’s,\nRobin: not immediately relevant, but yeah, pretty interesting.\nTris: Not immediately relevant. We are so language focused, and this has come into sharp relief for me quite personally. Recently, about five years ago, my dad had a very, very, very small, stroke, and he’s fine, but it did stop his ability to speak quickly.\nSo he’s, he can, he really has to struggle to get out a few words. Otherwise, he’s fine. He carries on doing all the things he, he, he loves doing. He just can’t talk about them very much. And seeing how people who don’t know him interact with him is shocking. They talk down to him. They think he’s stupid. And it’s because we think that if you don’t, if you, how you speak, how fast you speak, what you say, your accent, all these things are bundled up into quite a lot of things, but specifically intelligence.\nAnd it is so ingrained that in English, what is the word for somebody who cannot speak?\nDumb. word or unintelligence or at least it has been used for the same thing.\nRobin: yeah,\nTris: They’re so dumb.\nRobin: absolutely. Absolutely.\nTris: So, so the, when faced with something that can perfectly mimic speech and seemingly passes the Turing test, at least until you realize how to ask it, tricky questions. It is such a small step to think, oh, this has intelligence.\nBecause things that don’t have speech, things that can’t speak aren’t intelligent. So things that can speak my language focused brain is telling me that this must be intelligence as well.\nRobin: Yeah, absolutely. the thing\nTris: Hmm.\nabout how,prejudiced people are towards somebody who is not able to communicate in a way that we associate with intelligence,I think that’s so very true and also speaks to why LLMs [00:40:00] will be harmful. Mm-hmm.\nRobin: people take their polished language and they afford it far more authority than it should have. that\nTris: Oh yeah.\nmatters when it’s then speaking about things that are. Biases in themselves. Mm. Well, scams.\nRobin: that way of thinking about symbols is fascinating, but\nTris: Mm.\nRobin: fundamental reason why LMS are not providing us with useful, useful meaning.\nTris: Because they weren’t designed to,\nRobin: Yes.\nTris: the right, yeah. Yes, yes, yes. I, I, I agree. It is, it’s just a way of throwing that they, this, this, this, this example of the three levels of the, of words, the symbols and the actual reality. The, is a great way of throwing light onto making clear that LMS weren’t designed to make meaning,\nRobin: Yes.\nTris: if they were, they wouldn’t have been trained on words.\nI.\nI see. I see. Yeah. Yeah, no, that’s a good point. Yeah. and it also helps to illustrate the point that we are miles away from creating any kind of ai. if we were to try and create AI that could do what a human does Yeah.\nRobin: with generally understanding general novel problems and trying to figure out what a good solution to them would be if we were ever gonna try and do\nTris: Hmm.\nRobin: which is what people claim that LMS can do, and they just can’t. If you were ever gonna try and do that. we have fucking so far to go. Like\nTris: Yeah.\nRobin: we’re\nTris: What you need to do,\nRobin: near it.\nTris: what, what? Like, what you’d have to do in, and I am not expert in, in the, in the topic is, is. The way we know how to create human level intelligence is to have a general purpose brain connected to our senses and teach it about the world by letting it experience the world. And then like question mark, profit like that, that’s makes just the, the, the, the amount of input that our brains digest every second\nRobin: Yeah.\nTris: is unimaginable to me.\nRobin: I actually found\nTris: That’s how to do it.\nRobin: you watch, were you fan of Westworld?\nTris: I am aware of it. I have not yet watched it, but I have played Fallouts four, which is, you know, partially similar.\nRobin: this may be related. I don’t know. and I don’t think I’m spoiling it, but you are aware that Westworld contains,robotic people that, are supposed to have,the fabled, independent thought, Ability for independent thought and to act as\nTris: Right, and\nRobin: right?\nTris: have I got it right that, that some of them, or all of them or a category, think they’re human or do they know they’re\nRobin: no.\nTris: not human?\nyeah. Yeah, exactly. Okay.\nRobin: Yeah. Same as four. Four. Got it.\nand I don’t think I’m giving you a big spoiler here, but the theory behind what creates that in Westworld, which I thought was quite interesting, it’s this complete thought experiment stuff and not to be taken seriously,\nTris: Cool.\nRobin: Yeah.\nI thought it was quite interesting is the theory, is that the thing that really gives a artificial brain the experience to be able to unlock that consciousness. Is suffering is like you. so the horrific theory of Westworld is that you take these robots, you put them in situations where they’re going to be abused by humans a long time over and over again. And then\nTris: Whoa,\nRobin: they end up developing consciousness because of, because the level of sort, of richness of experience that they get through the trauma is basically what creates this consciousness, which I is horrifying as an idea. And also I find it fascinating personally, I dunno,\nTris: that is amazing. Is this, are, are the, are the creators of Westworld Buddhist, because isn’t that one of the four noble truths that the, that suffering is like an inherent part of la I, forgive me, I I’m not, I’m don’t remember my, my Buddhist education, but like, isn’t that one of the four core pillars of, of Buddhism is that suffering is like\nGod incredible. yes. the, look up the four noble truths. What,\nRobin: one,\nTris: is it?\nRobin: this is Wikipedia, is dka, I dunno if I’m pronouncing that Not being at ease. Suffering from Duch star, standing unstable DKA is an innate characteristic of transient existence. Nothing is forever, and this is painful.\nTris: I mean, no arguments there, but\nRobin: I\nTris: like,\nspot on. I dunno what that means though.\nRobin: wonderful.\n","id":"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/7/","title":"Ergonomic updates, digital garden beginnings, and the limits of LLMs"}},"docInfo":{"https://decapsulate.com/":{"body":14,"title":0},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/1/":{"body":7069,"title":3},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/2/":{"body":4949,"title":3},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/3/":{"body":5167,"title":5},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/4/":{"body":4564,"title":9},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/5/":{"body":6749,"title":9},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/6/":{"body":5665,"title":4},"https://decapsulate.com/episodes/7/":{"body":4036,"title":7}},"length":9},"lang":"English"}
